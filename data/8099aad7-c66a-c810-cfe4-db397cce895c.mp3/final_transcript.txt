Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Zoe. One day, Zoe was walking down a sidewalk with her mom when she saw a candy hidden under a bush. Zoe pointed it out to her mom, and they noticed that the candy had a golden wrapper. Zoe asked her mom if she could pick up the candy because the wrapper was still on it and it wasn't open. Zoe's mom said she wasn't sure, but eventually agreed. So, Zoe got the candy with the golden wrapper.

When she picked it up, she saw that it had a picture of a raffle ticket on it. Zoe asked her mom why the candy had a raffle ticket picture, and her mom said she didn't know but that Zoe could open it up. Zoe opened the golden candy wrapper, and once she did, she saw some words on the raffle ticket. The words said, "Write your name here," and Zoe asked her mom for a pen. Zoe's mom gave her a pen, and Zoe wrote her name on the raffle ticket. Then she turned it over to the other side.

On the other side of the raffle ticket, there was a picture of a helium balloon floating in the air, and it said, "Put this raffle ticket in a helium balloon." Zoe asked her mom if they could go to a store to get a helium balloon. Zoe's mom agreed, so they went to a big store that had lots of balloons, party decorations, bounce houses, cotton candy machines, and colorful napkins.

Zoe told her mom that they needed to get a helium balloon, so they picked out a big blue one with a picture of a bird on it. Before the store employee could blow up the balloon with helium, Zoe put her raffle ticket inside. Then they filled the balloon with helium, and the raffle ticket was inside. Zoe went outside with her mom, holding the balloon.

Suddenly, a big wind came and blew the balloon out of Zoe's hands. Zoe was sad because her raffle ticket was inside the balloon. But she saw that the wind was getting stronger, and the balloon with the raffle ticket inside was being carried away. The wind blew the balloon in one direction, and it floated over some houses in New South Wales, Australia.

As the balloon kept floating, a big bird with huge wings, as big as a car, saw the helium balloon and grabbed it. Zoe had never seen a balloon floating away and then being grabbed by a bird before. The bird carried the balloon through the sky all the way to a barn on the other side of town. Zoe told her mom to hurry and drive to the barn to see why the bird picked up the helium balloon with the raffle ticket and brought it there. Zoe's mom agreed, and they drove across town to the barn.

When they got to the barn, they saw some horses inside and a big golden tent with star stickers on it next to the barn. Zoe and her mom went to the barn, where they found a monkey dressed like a person who opened the barn door. The monkey couldn't talk, but it was wearing pants, a pajama shirt, and rain boots even though it was sunny outside. The monkey held Zoe's hand, and Zoe held her mom's hand. Together, they walked through the barn until they reached the other side, where the bird with the balloon and the raffle ticket was waiting.

The bird flew over to Zoe and popped the balloon. Zoe was startled by the loud noise, but then she saw the raffle ticket fall out. Now the raffle ticket looked different – it had tiny fireworks coming out of it. Zoe picked up the raffle ticket, and the monkey held her and her mom's hands again. They walked to the golden tent on the other side of the barn.

When they got to the golden tent, a voice asked if they knew the password. Zoe asked her mom if she knew it, but her mom said no. The monkey pointed to the raffle ticket, and Zoe saw that it had a password on it. She read the letters and saw that it said "ESO," which was her name, Zoe, spelled backward. So she said, "ESO," and the golden tent started to float in the air, getting bigger and bigger until it was the size of a circus tent. A rope ladder fell down from the tent, and the voice inside told Zoe to climb up with her mom and enter the golden tent because the raffle ticket was the only way anyone could get in.

Zoe held her raffle ticket, said "ESO," and climbed up the sturdy rope ladder with her mom. When they entered the tent, they saw a big copy machine that looked like a refrigerator. Zoe and her mom walked into the refrigerator-like machine, and when they came out the other side, there were six Zoes and two of her mom! All the Zoes and both moms were surprised and thought it was funny because now they could do different things at the same time.

They had a party in the tent, and when they were ready to leave, there was a slide instead of a rope ladder. All six Zoes and both moms slid down the slide and saw that the bird had turned into a horse. Zoe asked the horse where the raffle ticket went, and the horse pointed to her pocket. Zoe found the raffle ticket hidden in her pocket, so she knew how to get back to the tent if she ever wanted to make more copies of herself, her friends, or her dad.

Zoe, her mom, and all the other Zoes decided to take two cars back home that day because they didn't fit in one. And Zoe and her family lived happily ever after. The end! Thanks for listening to this story. Visit Makeupstories.com if you want to be on the podcast. Tell your friends!
