Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Portia. Portia wanted to go to the pool that day, so she asked, "Mom, Dad, can we go to the pool?" Her parents agreed it was a good idea. But Portia had an even better idea. She wanted her parents to find a sled and give her a sled ride all the way to the pool. But there was no snow. So, Portia told her parents they would have to pull the sled over the grass as they walked to the pool.

Portia had a secret in her pocket. She brought some food coloring and a little watermelon seed. Her mom pulled the sled with Portia sitting in it through the grass until they reached the pool. When they got there, Portia saw many chairs, towels, and floaties for kids to use. This was a special pool with free bubbles for kids to play with in the water.

Portia and her parents put on their bathing suits, ready to have fun in the pool. But first, Portia secretly poured red food coloring into the water. The pool changed from blue to red, and all the kids cheered, thinking it was a magic pool. But Portia knew the truth.

She went into the red pool with her parents, holding the secret watermelon seed. Portia kicked against the wall of the pool, making fun splashes. Then, she dropped the watermelon seed, which sank to the bottom of the pool.

It turns out the red food coloring had a little bit of magic in it. The watermelon seed started to grow into a big watermelon, getting bigger and bigger as the kids swam. A lifeguard noticed and said, "Look everyone, there's a big watermelon growing in the red pool!" Portia didn't tell anyone she had planted the seed.

The lifeguard asked everyone to leave the pool because the watermelon was getting so big it was pushing water out of the pool. Portia and her parents wrapped towels around themselves to stay warm. They watched as the watermelon grew so big it came out of the pool. All the kids were amazed by the giant watermelon.

Suddenly, the watermelon burst open, and bits of watermelon flew everywhere. It wasn't ordinary watermelon; it tasted like bubblegum. As the kids tried to eat the bubblegum watermelon, Portia saw a huge hairy monster inside the watermelon.

Portia realized the seed and red food coloring had created the special watermelon and the monster. The monster had three arms, eyes in its belly button, and lots of hair. The monster said, "NUM NUM numb," wanting to eat the bubblegum watermelon. Some kids were scared, but the monster put on silly glasses and started to giggle.

The monster dipped its head underwater and blew big bubbles. Some bubbles were so big that kids could fit inside. The kids realized the monster was a friendly candy monster, and they wanted to go inside the bubbles. Portia went first, and her parents joined her. The kids floated in the bubbles, high above the city of Auckland.

Portia wondered how they would get back down, and her parents pointed to the friendly monster. The monster looked at them through its silly glasses, and the bubbles gently floated back down to the pool. The kids giggled, enjoying the fun ride.

After they got out of the pool, Portia and her parents saw the monster getting smaller. The bubblegum watermelon started to disappear, and the pool changed back to its blue color. The monster shrank until it turned back into a watermelon, which then turned back into a seed. The seed disappeared through a secret underwater tunnel at the bottom of the pool.

The kids wondered how everything had happened, but only Portia knew the answer. She decided to keep it a secret, and Portia and her family lived happily ever after. The end.

Thanks for listening. Bye.
