Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Nikki who lived on a beach on a faraway island. The island had many trees that grew oranges, and sometimes when Nikki was walking with his family or riding his bicycle, he would reach up and pick an orange from a tree. The island also had a special kind of fruit called zulup, which was delicious because it had honey and graham cracker inside. 

One day, Nikki and his friend Jonah were walking on the beach when they saw a rocket ship come down from space. The rocket ship zoomed through the clouds with a fireball attached to its back. As it got closer, multicolored lights started flashing, and robot noises came from the rocket ship. Jonah suggested it might be an alien rocket ship, but Nikki didn't believe in aliens. 

Just then, a secret compartment in the rocket ship opened, revealing a large, black and white, soccer-ball-like object. A winged kitty cat emerged and flew down to the beach, landing next to Jonah and Nikki. The kitty cat, named Meow Meow, told them that the rocket ship could travel to different planets. Meow Meow had been to a planet where aliens were excellent at playing soccer because they had many legs. 

Nikki asked if Meow Meow had brought any soccer balls from the alien planet, and Meow Meow explained that the aliens' eyeballs looked like soccer balls. Skeptical, Nikki agreed to go on the rocket ship with Jonah and Meow Meow. Once on board, they discovered the rocket ship was full of soccer balls that helped it fly. 

The rocket ship blasted off into space, where they saw meteors, including one made of gold. Jonah and Nikki used a rope to catch the golden meteor and attached it to the rocket ship. As they returned to Earth, they found leprechauns waiting for them, who explained that they got their gold from meteors. 

Jonah and Nikki weren't sure if Meow Meow was telling the truth, but they lived happily ever after. The end.
