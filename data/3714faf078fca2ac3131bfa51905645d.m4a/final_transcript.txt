Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Adeline. When Adeline was younger, she saw some smoke outside and said, "Mom, it's so smoky outside, and now we can't play in the playground." Adeline's mom told her that after the smoke went away, they would go to Antarctica, where the South Pole is, for a great adventure.

One day, the smoke was gone, and Adeline's mom asked, "Do you think today's a good day for us to go on our adventure to the South Pole?" Adeline agreed but wondered how they would get there. Her mom explained they would take a big ship that would sail through the giant Pacific Ocean, past South America, all the way to the bottom of the Earth, where the South Pole is. The South Pole is so snowy that there are huge piles of snow as big as mountains.

Adeline was very excited. The next day, she went with her mom and dad to a big boat in San Francisco. They boarded the boat, and the captain announced, "Everyone, we're going to the South Pole! Don't worry if you didn't pack warm clothes and yummy treats; we have plenty on the boat." Adeline was happy to hear that.

They set sail, and the captain said, "Off we go." The ship sailed away from San Francisco, heading towards the South Pole. Adeline suggested stopping somewhere along the way for fishing or exploring an island. The captain explained they had a secret mission in the South Pole: a penguin would give them a treasure map leading to a princess castle.

As they approached the South Pole, Adeline saw white mountains of snow and felt the cold air. She asked for extra layers of clothing, and the captain brought a treasure box full of special clothes that could put themselves on. Adeline was amazed.

Adeline wondered how the boat could get to the South Pole so quickly. The captain revealed that two big blue whales were towing the boat under the water. Blue whales are the biggest, strongest animals on the planet, so they could pull the boat very fast.

When they arrived at the South Pole, a penguin jumped onto the boat, holding a glittery map. Adeline examined the map with a magnifying glass and saw secret glitter lines leading to a glitter castle in the clouds, where a princess lived.

Adeline, her parents, and the captain followed the map and found the floating glitter castle. The princess of the South Pole appeared with a giant frog, the king of all frogs. The princess told Adeline that she was the first one to find the castle, and as a reward, she could become a secret princess and tell only two friends.

Adeline said goodbye to the princess, the frog, and the floating glitter castle. The blue whales towed the ship back to San Francisco, and Adeline and her family returned home to Napa, California. They all lived happily ever after. The end.
