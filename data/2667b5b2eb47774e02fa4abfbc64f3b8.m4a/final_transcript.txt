Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. They thought they lived in a regular house because it had bathrooms, bedrooms, and a kitchen. But sometimes, while they were sleeping, they would hear strange noises. The grownups always told them not to worry about those noises, saying it was just the wind or something making a creaking sound. But Jonah and Jesse knew that the noises were really from something else.

One day, while Jonah and Jesse were alone in their room, the floor opened up, revealing a secret door that went under the floor. There were people with green faces and green arms, and it looked like they didn't have bones. They were more like rubbery, slimy people. They opened up the secret door under Jonah and Jesse's floor and asked if they wanted to visit their home below. They said they lived under Jonah and Jesse's house, and that's why sometimes they would hear noises and their parents would tell them not to worry.

Jonah and Jesse weren't sure if they should go, but the people seemed nice, so they decided to check it out for a little bit. They climbed down a ladder into the underground part of their house where the green slimy people lived. There were disco lights that were pink, yellow, and blue, spinning in circles. The green slimy people were driving around in bumper cars on ice, playing music, and bumping into each other. Jesse realized that this was the source of the nighttime noises. The green slimy people laughed because they thought it was so silly. They told Jonah and Jesse that sometimes they were noisy too. The green slimy people slept during the day, so when Jonah and Jesse were running around, they would be running on the floor above the green slimy people's ceiling. They told Jonah and Jesse that they used to be scared of them, but now they knew they were just people because they had never met people before.

Jonah and Jesse asked where the green slimy people came from because they'd never seen anyone like them before. They said they used to be people too, but they turned green after eating a special kind of grass. This grass stopped them from getting old and dying, but instead, they turned into green slimy people and had to live underground. They couldn't be exposed to sunlight because it would melt their slime, but disco lights were okay because they weren't too bright.

Jonah and Jesse told the green slimy people that they needed to go back to their room because their parents would be worried if they weren't in their bunk beds in the morning. The green slimy people agreed, and Jonah and Jesse climbed back up the ladder, closed the hatch on their floor, and went back to bed. When they thought it was morning, they rushed to their parents' room and told them about the green slimy people living under the floor. At first, their parents, Steve and Amanda, were quiet because grownups try to keep these slimy people a secret from kids. That's why they say it's just noises at night, so kids don't try to find the green slimy people and stay up all night playing.

Steve and Amanda suggested that Jonah and Jesse might have just had a dream, but the kids insisted it was real. Jonah took his dad's hand and led him to their room, trying to show him the secret door under the floor. But it was stuck and wouldn't open. Jonah insisted that it had opened the night before, but Steve thought Jonah was just playing a trick. Jonah suggested that his parents sleep in their room that night, so they could see for themselves.

The next night, Steve and Amanda shared the bottom bunk bed, while Jesse and Jonah stayed on the top. The green slimy people wanted to play, so they opened the hatch on the floor, not knowing the parents were there. Steve and Amanda were surprised but happy to play too. They all went down into the hatch, and this time, they played a different game - a snowball fight with green snow that turned into sprinkles when thrown. It was a lot of fun, especially since they could eat the snowballs.

Soon, it was almost morning, and they needed to get some sleep. Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda said they'd visit again, and one of the green slimy creatures showed them a special green slime device. If they put their finger in it and touched the slime, it would cover their body and take a picture of their brain, saving all their memories. This way, when they were going to die, they could become green slimy creatures and remember everything from when they were people. They asked if they wanted to try the green slime, but Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda said, "Not today, but maybe when we're older." They went back to their room, closed the hatch, and went to sleep. Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda lived happily ever after. The end.
