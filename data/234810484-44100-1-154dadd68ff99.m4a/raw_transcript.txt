Hey, listeners. This is Steve, the host of Makeup Stories, and I want to apologize for how much time I've been taking off of makesup Stories. I will be back telling stories soon. And for all of the kids who sent in story requests, I did receive them, and I will get to them. In the meantime, if you want to be notified when a new story comes out, ask your parents to click subscribe. Thank you and see you soon.
