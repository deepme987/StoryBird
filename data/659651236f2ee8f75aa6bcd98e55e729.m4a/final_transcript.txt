Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Gilda. It was raining outside Gilda's house. Gilda's mom told him they could put on rain boots, a rain jacket, and even use a Paw Patrol umbrella, and then they could go outside to splash in the puddles. Gilda agreed, put on his boots, raincoat, and grabbed his Paw Patrol umbrella, and went outside. When he stepped out of his house, he saw an upside-down rainbow, with the top on the ground and the bottom in the sky. Gilda told his mom, "Mom, look, I found the first upside-down rainbow ever!" His mom replied, "What? Maybe there's some gold."

Gilda's mom suggested they go to the rainbow since they had all sorts of rain gear, and they should see if there was gold at the end of the rainbow. Gilda agreed and asked his mom where rainbows come from. Gilda's mom explained that rainbows are made when special rainbow dust comes down with the rain. Sometimes, the dust forms lines and shapes, creating a rainbow. Gilda wondered why the rainbow dust for this rainbow didn't fall from the sky the right way, and his mom said, "Let's go check it out."

They started splish-splashing in puddles and walked all the way to the rainbow. When they got there, they saw many bananas on the ground. Gilda said, "Mom, there's no treasure at the end of the rainbow. It's just so many bananas." His mom noticed the bananas were rainbow-colored, and some were even on the rainbow slide. Gilda asked if they could try a rainbow banana, and his mom agreed. They opened a rainbow banana, and it was glowing. Gilda asked if it was safe to eat, and his mom decided to take a bite first. As she did, her hair turned rainbow-colored, and her clothes turned to gold. Gilda exclaimed, "Mom, we're rich now! We can buy all the candy in the world."

Gilda's mom looked at her gold clothes and offered Gilda a bite. He took a bite, and his clothes turned gold, including his Paw Patrol umbrella, boots, and raincoat. Gilda suggested they bring some rainbow bananas home, and his mom agreed. They carried two bananas back to their house. When they got home, Gilda said they should plant a rainbow banana tree. His mom agreed, and Gilda planted a rainbow banana in the ground, watering it with colorful blue food coloring. Then they went inside to wait.

The next day, Gilda went outside and saw a big rainbow banana tree. The tree had legs, eyes, a mouth, and could walk. The tree told Gilda it could turn into a magical treehouse because it came from a rainbow banana in the middle of an upside-down rainbow. Gilda asked the tree to show him, and the tree said, "Huff, puff cupuff," turning into a banana treehouse. The treehouse was so much fun, with a rope ladder, a pretend kitchen that could cook real cookies, and a cold area for making popsicles and ice cream. All they had to do was put a rainbow banana in the kitchen and say what they wanted it to turn into, like a cookie, ice cream cone, or birthday cake.

Many kids from Pittstown, New Jersey, asked Gilda if they could come into the banana tree treehouse. Gilda agreed, and the tree would walk to other kids' houses, letting them have muffins, cookies, and other yummy treats. But the tree got tired and asked Gilda's mom to plug it in for electricity. She did, and the tree got so much energy that it started to fly. The banana tree could now fly on top of Gilda's house, and Gilda had a secret way to get from his bedroom to the treehouse on the roof. Gilda and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
