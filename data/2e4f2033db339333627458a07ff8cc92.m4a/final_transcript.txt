Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Darvis. Darvis lived in a regular house in Hamilton, New Zealand, with a regular door, a regular roof, and regular windows. Sometimes, Darvis's friends would come over to play with toys, or they would go in the backyard to play catch or run around. But neither Darvis nor his friends knew the secret hidden beneath his house. You see, a long time before Darvis was born, even before his parents were born, a dragon had laid eggs and buried them all over Hamilton, New Zealand. Over the years, dirt and soil covered the dragon eggs. When people came to New Zealand and started building houses, they didn't know that dragon eggs were hidden beneath their homes. Darvis and his friends played catch and climbed trees, never knowing about the dragon eggs below.

One night, Darvis had a dream. In his dream, there was a little earthquake that shook the ground, causing the dragon eggs to hatch. Baby dragons emerged from the ground, asking Darvis to help them find their mamas. In his dream, Darvis told the baby dragons he didn't know where their moms were, but he would take them to his house above ground. The dragons followed Darvis into his house, and Darvis told his mom about the hatching dragons. His mom said it was just a dream, but when Darvis woke up the next day, he saw a real hole in the ground next to his house. He noticed more holes in his neighbors' yards and all around town. Darvis told his parents about his dream, but they thought it might have been meteors or construction workers digging during the night. Darvis disagreed, saying it must have been the baby dragons.

Darvis and his parents walked around town, searching for clues about the mysterious holes. They couldn't find any footprints because dragons have wings. Suddenly, Darvis spotted a monkey in a tree, and more monkeys appeared all around them. The monkeys were little capuchin monkeys, sticking their tongues out and jumping in the trees to get Darvis and his family's attention. Darvis called the monkeys over, and his dad quickly ran to get bananas and grapes for the monkeys. When his dad returned with the treats, the monkeys jumped down and started eating.

To everyone's surprise, the monkeys began to talk! They spoke English, but in a silly, robotic way. The monkeys told Darvis that during the night, they heard loud noises, felt flapping wings, and saw eyes in the sky, but they couldn't tell what it was. Darvis believed this was a clue that there really were dragons.

Suddenly, Darvis and his parents looked up and saw a big jeep being carried by baby dragons in the sky. The jeep had grown wings from the dragons, and it didn't need a parachute or a regular engine because the dragons' fire powered it like a rocket. The jeep landed gently on a roof near Darvis's house and parked right in front of it. One of the baby dragons told Darvis to take a close look at the jeep. It had big knobby tires for off-roading, bright headlights, and rocket boosters in the back. The dragon wings allowed it to fly faster than an airplane, even faster than a fighter jet, but not as fast as light.

Darvis got to ride in the dragon-powered jeep, flying over New Zealand and seeing wonderful sights, like kids playing on a seesaw. When they returned to Hamilton, everyone was so happy that friendly baby dragons had hatched and brought a new way to create rocket cars using dragon power. Darvis and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
