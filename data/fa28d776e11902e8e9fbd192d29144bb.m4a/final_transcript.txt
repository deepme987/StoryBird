Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a girl named Lulu. Lulu lived in a city called Boston. Her mom and dad loved to bake cakes, but they usually didn't give any to Lulu. Lulu said, "That's not fair. I want some cake."

Lulu's mom replied, "Lulu, when it's your birthday, you can have a special cake. What kind of cake do you want?" Lulu excitedly said, "I want a cake shaped like a unicorn." Her mom agreed, "Okay."

The next day was Lulu's fourth birthday. She woke up and checked the fridge, but there was no unicorn cake. She asked her mom why, and her mom said they still had to make it. Lulu asked if she could help, and her mom said, "Okay."

Lulu took some cake mix and put it in a big bowl. Her parents hadn't let her try baking before, but today was her birthday, and she was turning four. Lulu mixed the cake, adding sugar, rainbow sprinkles, and special twinkly sugar she found in a treasure box.

Lulu mixed the twinkly sugar into the cake until it got hard. Her mom said, "Now it's time to make the unicorn shape." They used special tools to shape the cake and put it in the oven.

While the cake baked, Lulu thought she heard it singing, "Somewhere over the rainbow, hiccup." When the cake was done, they opened the oven and saw a beautiful unicorn-shaped cake with twinkly, sparkly bits.

Lulu's mom said they needed to let the cake cool in the fridge before eating it. Lulu took a nap while it cooled. When she woke up, it was raining outside, but the clouds were starting to clear.

Lulu went downstairs and asked her mom to open the fridge because it was time for her unicorn cake. When they opened the fridge, they heard the cake singing, "Somewhere over the rainbow, hiccup."

Lulu told her mom she thought the special twinkly sugar made the cake sing. Her mom suggested they stand the cake up on its legs before adding frosting. When they did, the cake grew a horn and started singing again. Its legs began to move, and it jumped out the window, growing bigger and bigger in the rain until it was the size of a real unicorn.

Lulu was amazed and asked her mom if she could ride the unicorn. Her mom agreed, but said she had to watch. They climbed onto the unicorn and saw a rainbow. At the end of the rainbow, they saw a girl named Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was fixing a treasure box with a wooden mallet.

Lulu asked Ruth if they could see what was inside the box. Ruth opened it, revealing the special twinkly sugar that made the unicorn. Lulu realized that's where the sugar came from, and Ruth confirmed it.

Lulu invited Ruth to ride the unicorn with her, and they all went back to Lulu's house in Boston. When they arrived, Lulu's dad had made another birthday cake - half ice cream, half carrot cake, with trees on top.

Lulu's mom sang "Happy Birthday," and Lulu blew out the candles. The unicorn disappeared, but Lulu wasn't sad because she had a yummy cake, new friends, and she had just turned four years old. Lulu and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
