Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a dinosaur with helicopter wings named Timmy. Timmy the dinosaur loved to fly, but he didn't have regular wings that went flap flap. Instead, when Timmy wanted to fly, he would turn on his helicopter wings, and they would spin around super fast, making him fly. Timmy was great at soccer, volleyball, baseball, and many other outdoor activities. He loved playing with other dinosaurs.

One day, Timmy met a magic wizard who told him that if a meteor ever came, he should fly up into the sky so the meteor wouldn't hit him. The wizard then said goodbye. The next day, Timmy saw a big toothpaste meteor coming towards Earth. Timmy didn't want the toothpaste to fall on him, so he used his helicopter wings to fly up into the sky before the meteor hit the Earth.

From the sky, Timmy saw that the toothpaste made all the dinosaurs go forward in time. They became invisible for a long time, and that's why people thought dinosaurs were gone. But it was just the magic toothpaste that made them disappear for a little while.

One day, a girl named Neve saw Timmy the T-Rex with helicopter wings outside her window. She called her parents to look, and they were amazed to see a real dinosaur. Neve noticed that Timmy had magic toothpaste on his feet.

Timmy the T-Rex decided to talk and invited Neve and her parents on a magical ride. Neve climbed onto Timmy, and her parents sat in the back. Since it was Neve's birthday, she got to sit in front. Neve's mom put a special, ticklish seatbelt on her that didn't hurt at all.

Timmy asked Neve if she was ready, and she said yes. Timmy started his helicopter wings, and they flew high up into the sky. Neve felt safe because of the magic seatbelt, so she asked Timmy to fly even higher. Neve and her parents wanted to go to the moon, but Timmy said it wouldn't be easy. Neve told him about a blue bear who lived in outer space and could help them get there.

Timmy agreed, and they flew faster until they reached space. They saw the blue bear, who was Neve's friend, and he helped guide them to the moon. The blue bear told Timmy to spin his helicopter wings the other way to land on the moon. They landed safely, and Neve found a princess crown with a note saying that whoever wore it would become a real princess.

The blue bear placed the crown on Neve's head, and she became a princess. Neve, the blue bear, and Timmy held hands, looking at Earth from the moon. Neve's parents were waiting on Timmy's back, and they suggested going home to see if their house had turned into a castle.

Neve said goodbye to the blue bear, promising to see him again someday. They all flew back to Earth, and when they arrived, they found that Neve's house had turned into a beautiful castle. Neve's dad became a king, her mom became a queen, and they all lived happily ever after as the royal family of Tennessee. The end.
