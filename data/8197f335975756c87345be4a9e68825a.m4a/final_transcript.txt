Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Julia. Julia was going with her brother Theodore, and their parents were taking them in a car all the way to a petting zoo. Julia had heard that there was a new petting zoo in town and they wanted to go see it. So, they got in the car and Julia and Theodore were buckled in their car seats. At first, they thought the seats were too tight, but then they decided it was okay. They both got some snacks, opened the windows, and sang songs as they went to the new petting zoo.

After a few turns, they arrived at the petting zoo. The petting zoo was funny because the fence was made of crayons, but not regular crayons. These crayons were bigger and sturdier, with brown crayon poles and green crayon grass. Right away, Julia and Theodore knew this wasn't going to be a regular petting zoo. It seemed like it was going to be an adventure petting zoo.

Julia and Theodore's mom parked in the parking lot by the petting zoo. The parking lot was really silly because it was made of Lego. There were also pretend people in charge of directing cars, but they just held up their pretend hands because they couldn't move them. After parking, their parents helped them get out of their car seats, and they went to the Adventure petting zoo.

The Adventure petting zoo had two big straws at the entrance, with a special red juice flowing from the top. Kids could run under it, but they had to be careful not to get the juice on them, or their hair would get sticky. Inside the petting zoo, the first thing they saw were purple sheep with little lights on their fur. The sheep were really silly, so Julia and Theodore asked if they could see them first. Their parents said okay.

They went to the purple sheep area, and the purple sheep started to talk. When the purple sheep talked, the letters of the words came out of its mouth. So if the purple sheep said "hi," the letters H and I came out, and Julia and Theodore caught them. Julia caught the H, and Theodore caught the I. Then they decided to go on a sheep ride, and their parents followed them as the sheep took them down a secret tunnel.

In the secret tunnel, there were old mummies covered in jello. Some mummies were in red jello and some in green jello. There were signs with pictures of spoons and a cross next to them, so Julia and Theodore knew they weren't allowed to use spoons for that jello because it was just for mummies. The purple sheep kept taking them through the tunnel, and when they got out on the other side, they saw a huge pyramid.

The pyramid was so big, it was like a giant building with a triangle on top. It was made of diamond and gold, a special pyramid that only the purple sheep knew how to get to. Julia and Theodore got really close to the pyramid, and when they spoke to it, the letters of their words came out and echoed, bouncing around the room for everyone to catch.

The gold and diamond pyramid was special because anyone could fly kites around it, even if there was no wind. So Julia and Theodore flew magical kites next to the pyramid, singing songs and watching the letters from their songs float in the air. Everyone watching cheered and clapped because it was so cool.

Julia and Theodore decided to go on a boat they saw nearby. The boat was shaped like a cucumber and seemed to be made of cucumber, but sturdier. The middle part was hollowed out for seats, and it had a fan at the end to move it. They got in the cucumber boat, which went down a special stream through the tunnel to the other side of the Adventure petting zoo.

On the other side, they saw many wonderful animals. These animals were upside-down animals that could only walk on the ceiling, not the ground. When they needed to drink water, they used big candy cane-shaped straws to drink from the floor while upside down on the ceiling.

All the animals on this side of the petting zoo liked to sing silly songs that didn't make much sense and play clapping games, which sounded funny and made all the animals laugh. Soon, it was getting late, and their parents told Julia and Theodore it was time to leave the petting zoo. They said goodbye to the animals and went back home to their regular house, where they lived happily ever after. The end.
