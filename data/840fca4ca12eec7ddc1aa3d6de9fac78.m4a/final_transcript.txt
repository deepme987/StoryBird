Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four-year-old boy named Ruben. Ruben's birthday party was coming up, and he had a special idea for his celebration. Usually, kids have cake with candles that they light and blow out while everyone sings "Happy Birthday." But Ruben wanted something different - he wanted glow-in-the-dark candles with green flames!

So Ruben asked his mom, "Mom, can you find glow-in-the-dark candles?" His mom replied, "Ruben, I looked in the store, but they didn't have any." Ruben then told his mom about a secret cave with blue glow-in-the-dark worms that made special glowing wormwax. He said they needed to go on an adventure to find the cave and get the wormwax for his birthday cake.

The next day, Ruben and his mom went to the secret cave. Ruben brought his flashlight and carefully explored the cave with his mom. They found many glow worms and collected their glowing wormwax in a plastic bag. Then, they went back home.

At home, Ruben and his mom shaped the wormwax into candles and added string for wicks. When Ruben's birthday arrived, they lit the candles, and everyone sang "Happy Birthday" in the dark. The candles glowed, and the walls and ceiling got covered in glow-in-the-dark paint from the melting wax.

Ruben asked his parents to turn off all the lights so they could enjoy the glow-in-the-dark party. His cake even glowed! Ruben and his family ate the cake, and they all started to glow too. Ruben told them they needed to go back to the cave and sing a special song to the worms to stop glowing.

Back in the cave, Ruben sang the song, and the worms danced. Suddenly, a glow-in-the-dark jaguar appeared and told them about a crayon-eating dragon named Driggy who could help them stop glowing. Ruben remembered he brought extra birthday cake and offered it to Driggy. The dragon loved the cake and agreed to help.

Driggy breathed colorful, safe fire on Ruben and his friends, making them stop glowing during the day. Ruben went home and told his family about his great adventure. Ruben and his friends lived happily ever after. The end.
