Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Jonah. One night, as Jonah was in his pajamas, lying in bed and starting to fall asleep, he began to dream. In his dream, his mom was downstairs baking a cake. Jonah got up and walked downstairs, only to discover that it was a magical cake his mom was baking. He asked if he could have a piece of the magical cake, and his mom said yes. When Jonah's mom cut a slice, he saw that it was rainbow-colored inside. As he took bites of the magical cake, he noticed it didn't taste like regular cake or even food. Instead, it tasted like water and turned into a sugary liquid in his mouth.

Jonah knew that eating the magic cake would give him magical powers. His first power was the ability to make any food he wanted appear by drawing it with crayons. If he drew a cookie, a cookie would appear, and if he drew a cupcake, a cupcake would appear. Jonah's second power was the ability to make it anyone's birthday whenever he wanted. He went to the playground and asked some kids when their birthdays were. One said December 7th, and another said November 18th. Jonah told them they could have an extra birthday today. They didn't believe him, but when Jonah said the magic words "We Gahumba," both kids had an extra birthday and skipped a year, growing older right before everyone's eyes. Jonah even made himself grow up with the magic words.

The magic cake gave Jonah even more special powers. He could move balls just by concentrating and looking at them. Soccer balls would kick themselves, and baseballs would hit themselves. Jonah also discovered he had magic eyes that could make holes in clouds and create friendly tornadoes that put things in the right place. He even started to float a little bit above the ground and could walk on air. Jonah could also read the thoughts of the kids around him, knowing what they were thinking before they said it.

Jonah's next power was the ability to turn his head all the way around like an owl and stretch his arms and legs as far as he wanted. He could reach up to the sky or walk across many cities at once. Jonah was surprised that a cake with so many magic powers didn't taste like anything but sugary water. He asked his mom about the magic ingredient, and she said that while she was sleeping, she dreamed of little leprechauns who brought magic sugar to bake the cake. She woke up to find the cake there and was surprised that Jonah was still dreaming while eating it. Jonah decided it was time to wake up.

When Jonah opened his eyes, he saw that his ceiling was turning into clouds and sky, and the light in his room was becoming a little sun. He realized that his magical powers were now part of his real life. Jonah told his mom he wanted to go outside and use his magic powers, but she said he had to go to school first. The next day, Jonah started first grade, and all the kids wanted to know about his magic powers. He kept them a secret until one day at recess when he showed them some of his powers. All the kids thought it was so cool, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
