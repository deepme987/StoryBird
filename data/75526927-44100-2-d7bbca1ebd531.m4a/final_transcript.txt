Once upon a time, there was a boy named Andrew who had just turned five years old. He lived with his family in a big treehouse in someone's backyard. This treehouse had stairs so that he could go up and down easily. It even had a kitchen upstairs! But instead of using fire to cook, they used magnifying glasses to focus sunlight on the stove, so they wouldn't accidentally burn the tree down.

In the treehouse, there were many beds and bathrooms. But when Andrew needed to go peepee, he had to do it off the tree. To get down from the treehouse, there were rope ladders and a pole. When Andrew turned five, his parents said he could use the pole, but he had to wear a helmet to protect his head.

One day, Andrew slid down the pole and found his friend Dan waiting for him. Dan suggested they build something together. First, they went to Dan's house to eat some Lucky Charms cereal. Dan's dad poured milk into bowls and added the cereal. Andrew and Dan used their spoons to spin the cereal around and then clinked their spoons together, saying "cheers!" As they did this, they saw a magical spark and heard a strange sound: "Goom DA dum dum dum dum dum dum." Andrew wondered what caused the spark, but Dan's dad thought they were just pretending.

Later, Dan's dad let them play alone in the backyard. They decided to use dirt to make a tiger sculpture. They used shovels to dig up dirt and then shaped it into a tiger with their fingers. They even added some of their own hair to the tiger. When they finished, they showed Dan's dad, who carefully picked up the fragile dirt tiger.

Dan and Andrew had an idea: they would put the dirt tiger and the Lucky Charms that made the spark in the microwave to see what would happen. Dan's dad agreed, and they placed the dirt tiger and cereal in the microwave. They saw lightning and sparks inside, so they looked away.

When they looked back, the microwave beeped, and out came a real, rainbow-colored tiger! It was the same size as the dirt tiger they made. Dan and Andrew couldn't believe they had made a tiny, colorful tiger. The little tiger, which they named Tiggy, was even smaller than a kitten and had tiny claws and teeth.

Andrew suggested they take Tiggy to his treehouse. Dan and his dad agreed, so they walked through the neighborhood, over rocks and along a stream, until they reached Andrew's treehouse. They climbed the rope ladders with Tiggy on their backs.

When they reached the treehouse kitchen, Tiggy saw the magnifying glasses and tried to hit one. Andrew's mom stopped him, explaining that they needed the magnifying glasses to cook. Tiggy's paw got stuck to a magnifying glass, and Andrew's mom saw the colorful little tiger. She asked how they got Tiggy, and Andrew told her the whole story. She thought it was very special.

Dan and Andrew were allowed to keep Tiggy, even though he messed with the magnifying glasses. Tiggy lived with Andrew in the treehouse and visited Dan sometimes. As Tiggy grew, he stayed rainbow-colored and only grew as big as a kitten. Dan, Andrew, and Tiggy lived happily ever after. The end.
