Once upon a time, there was a big boy named Frank. Frank lived with his family on a farm. But Frank's family didn't have a house or a barn. So, they decided to dig a hole underground. While digging, they found a rabbit tunnel and decided to dig past it to make a whole house under the ground. Frank's job was to build a ladder so they could get in and out of the underground house. 

When you went down the ladder, you would enter his mom and dad's bedroom. After that, you would find the special underground pool where Frank liked to keep some of his froggies. Next to the pool, where Frank kept his froggies and sometimes had baths, was the special underground, secret, super-duper chamber with slides, a climbing structure, and swings. After the underground playground, you would reach the super-duper, extra special, very fantastic room, which only Frank was allowed to enter. That room was full of rabbits. Frank was an expert rabbit keeper because rabbits live underground, just like Frank and his family. In that room, Frank had a special carrot garden with different colored carrots to give to the rabbits. Some carrots were orange, some were blue, and some were purple. It took Frank and his parents six days to dig that deep because they had a metal shovel.

Frank had a lot of fun living in this house. But he didn't like that his bed was made of dirt. So, he asked his mom and dad for a special bed. They agreed, so they climbed out of the rope ladder that Frank made to get into their underground house. His dad drove a tractor to the mattress store. Frank wanted a fluffy, comfy, and bouncy mattress. They found a small mattress perfect for kids, paid the store owner, and loaded it onto the tractor. Frank and his dad drove back to their underground house. 

When they got there, it was hard to fit the mattress through the opening hole. So, Frank suggested rolling the mattress into a circle and then fitting it in. They followed his idea, and it worked. That night, Frank slept on the mattress and had a very special dream.

In the dream, the farm above had lambs and cows racing to the other side where there were sheep. The winner had to say "moo" or "baa." That day, the cow won because it was bigger and stronger. The sad lamb walked alone at the edge of the farm when a mean, scary tiger appeared. The tiger started stalking the lamb, planning to eat it.

During the dream, Frank decided to ride a cow and bring the rope ladder with him. From high up, he saw the sneaky tiger. He took apart the rope ladder and made it into a lasso. Frank rode the cow towards the lamb to save it. Just as the tiger got close, he threw the lasso around the tiger's neck and caught it. The tiger couldn't open its mouth and was scared, so it stopped.

Frank didn't know what to do next because he was a little scared. Luckily, his father heard the commotion and asked if everything was okay. Frank said yes and asked his dad to come out of the underground house. But his father couldn't come out because there was no ladder. So, Frank's mom suggested using Frank's new mattress as a step for his dad to climb out. They did that, and his dad came out to the farm. 

Frank asked his dad what to do about the tiger. His dad said he would throw a piece of meat far away, and the tiger would go eat it and never come back. So, they did that, and the tiger ran away.

Frank and his dad fixed the ladder, put it back in their underground house, and went inside to tell the mom the story. She said it was a special story. Just then, Frank woke up from his dream and realized it was all a dream. He was a little scared because of the tiger, so he told his parents about the dream. They said it was a special dream because he saved the day. Frank suggested they build a house above ground for emergencies, and his parents agreed. The next day, they started building a wooden house above ground and decided their underground house would be their secret chamber.

After they finished building their house, whenever Frank invited friends over, he would show them the secret underground house. All his friends thought it was so much fun, especially the slide and climbing structure. Frank and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
