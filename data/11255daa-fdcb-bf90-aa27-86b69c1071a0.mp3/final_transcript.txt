Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Winnie. Winnie lived on a farm with many animals to play with. There was a goat, two sheep, a pony named Penny, and a cat that lived in the barn. Winnie was very lucky because lots of kids would visit her farm to pet the animals and feed them. They always told Winnie how much they loved her and wished they could stay longer to learn about the animals.

One night, Winnie had a special dream where all the animals on her farm multiplied, and her farm grew bigger and bigger until it was the size of a whole city! When Winnie woke up, she looked out her window to see if her dream came true. But instead, she saw that her farm had disappeared! The barn, the cat, the goat, the sheep, and Penny the pony were all gone. Winnie asked her mom what happened, and her mom said she didn't know. So they both went outside to investigate, and they found that the ground had turned into glitter.

Winnie told her mom about her dream and how sad she was that her farm was gone. They decided to look for clues, so they put on their boots and went outside. When Winnie stepped on the glitter, some of it floated into the air. She told her mom that the glitter was a clue.

Winnie decided to collect some glitter in a bucket. She went inside, scooped up the glitter with a shovel, and put it into the bucket. Then she had a special idea: she would mix the glitter and see what happened. Winnie stirred and stirred, but the glitter stayed the same. So she decided to pour the glitter into a bathtub full of water. The water was soon covered with glitter.

As the glitter floated in the water, bubbles started to form, even though Winnie hadn't added any bubble bath. Suddenly, a fairy appeared inside one of the bubbles! The fairy tried to use her magic wand to pop the bubble, but it didn't work. So Winnie kept mixing the glitter, and a mermaid appeared in the bathtub! The mermaid told Winnie that her fairy friend was trapped in a bubble. The mermaid then created a big wave in the bath, causing the glitter to float in the air again. The bubble with the fairy inside popped, and the fairy flew out to hug the mermaid.

The fairy and the mermaid told Winnie that they used to live in a secret lake in a rainforest. They had a dream about being on a farm, but when they woke up, they were in the glittery bathtub. Winnie told them about her dream and her missing farm. The mermaid then revealed a secret: Winnie was a magical princess! Her magic made the opposite of her dreams come true.

Winnie wondered if she could get a princess dress. The fairy gave her the magic wand, and Winnie waved it, creating a beautiful dress. Then, Winnie had an idea: she would wish for her farm to never come back, knowing the opposite would happen. She waved the wand and made her wish, and her farm reappeared! The glitter turned back into the animals, and everything was as it was before.

Winnie made another wish: she hoped the fairy and mermaid would disappear and never stay forever. But the opposite happened, and they became her friends, staying with her as pets. Winnie had saved the day by making her farm reappear, and she learned how to use her magic power. Winnie and her family, along with the fairy and the mermaid, lived happily ever after. The end.
