Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Chase. One day, when Chase woke up, he heard a ding-dong, like someone rang his doorbell. Chase looked at the door and called his mom and dad. They opened the door and saw a big green box with flowers on top, a big ribbon, and gift wrapping. The box was standing on a very special piece of chocolate that didn't melt or get dirty, even if it was on the floor.

Chase asked his parents to bring the chocolate and the big box inside so they could open it. They agreed, and Chase carefully opened the ribbon and gift wrapping. He used a butter knife to open the green box and found a special scooter inside. Regular scooters have one wheel in the front and one in the back, but this scooter had 100 caterpillar legs that moved automatically!

To make the scooter go, Chase had to put a piece of chocolate into a little slot on the scooter. He hopped on the scooter and asked his mom and dad to follow him. The scooter took Chase on a special trail, and they soon reached a new path with a sign that said, "Lions are here." Chase asked his parents if there really were lions, and his mom spotted some baby lions. She said it was safe to go in because they were just babies, and they could even talk in lion language!

Chase scooted through the forest on his caterpillar leg scooter, and in the middle of the forest, he found a big bathtub with a crying baby lion inside. Chase and his parents asked the baby lion if it was okay, speaking in lion language by saying "RA" at the beginning and end of their sentences. The baby lion said it was sad because it got shampoo in its eyes.

Chase asked how he could help, and the lion said that if he took a little piece of chocolate from the scooter and put it in the bathtub, the shampoo would go away. The lion could then use a drop of water to clean its eyes. Chase gave the lion a piece of chocolate, and the water in the bathtub became crystal clear. The lion used a drop of water to clean its eyes, and it stopped crying.

The lion thanked Chase for the special chocolate from his caterpillar scooter and invited him to see the special lion house. Chase was curious about how the chocolate made the scooter go and how it helped the lion. He learned that the chocolate came from a factory run by fairies who used their magic wands to give it special powers.

Chase, his mom, and dad followed the lion to the lion house, which was full of decorations and toys for the baby lions. Inside the lion house, they found a magic carpet that cleaned up spills all by itself! Chase had fun spilling things like milk and Cheerios on the carpet, watching them clean up instantly and fly back to where they came from.

After a fun day at the lion house, Chase's mom and dad said it was time to go home. Chase thanked the lions for the adventure and left them an extra piece of chocolate. They all said goodbye, and Chase and his parents went back home, living happily ever after. The end.
