Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a kid named Jesse. One day, Jesse was walking beside a garden when he noticed it was getting foggy and the sun was setting very quickly. One moment it was the middle of the day, and then the sun zoomed down the sky. The sky was filled with sunset colors like orange and pink. Then it got dark, and the fog surrounded Jesse. A full moon appeared in the sky.

Next to some tulips in the garden, a magician appeared. The magician told Jesse that he had stepped on a magic flower that woke him up after sleeping for 10,000 years. The magician wore a red robe and a shirt made out of a tablecloth. He told Jesse that because he woke him up, he would give Jesse a special seed. Jesse opened his hand, and the magician gave him a little seed shaped like a person. Then the magician ran away.

After the magician left, the moon fell out of the sky and dropped into a lake. Suddenly, the sun came up again with pretty sunrise colors like orange and green. The fog lifted, and Jesse saw his parents right behind him. Jesse's mom asked, "Where did you go?" Jesse told her about the nighttime adventure and the magician who gave him a person-shaped seed. His mom asked what he would do with it, and Jesse said he would plant it at home.

When they got home, Jesse went to the backyard and used a little shovel to dig a hole. He put the seed in the ground, covered it with dirt, and watered it. Jesse thought it would take a long time for the seed to grow, but his mom told him to look outside. The seed was already growing into a tree! The tree had a big trunk and branches that grew very quickly. Instead of leaves, the tree grew people wearing magic capes, wizard hats, and pointy green shoes.

Jesse couldn't believe it, so he called his older brother Jonah to see the people tree. Jesse told Jonah about the magician and the seed. Jonah said it was incredible. Just then, the people on the tree jumped off, held hands, and danced in a circle above Jesse and Jonah's heads. They were about the size of elves and sang a song in a strange language.

Jesse told Jonah that they now had magicians, wizards, sorcerers, and nice witches on their team. Jesse told them to stop dancing, and they did. He told them to clean his room, and they rushed inside to do it. Jesse asked for toys, and they magically appeared, including a life-sized Lightning McQueen and a dollhouse that made you invisible when you went inside.

It was a hot day, so Jesse asked a wizard to make it colder. The wizard blew out cold air, and it got colder and colder until everything froze. Jesse worried they would be stuck in the ice forever, but a nice witch saw them and pressed a button to make the earth warm again.

Jesse and Jonah asked the magicians to make the people tree and themselves invisible so no one else could see them. For the rest of their lives, Jesse and Jonah had a secret group of magical friends who did whatever they said. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
