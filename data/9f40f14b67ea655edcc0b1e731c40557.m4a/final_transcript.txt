Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a kid named Jonah, who was the king of a faraway land. King Jonah lived in a castle and taught everyone how to get rid of ants that had invaded a candy factory in a mountain. The houses in King Jonah's kingdom had balloons, and they could float up if you wanted them to. You could also make them go lower and steer the houses.

One day, someone decided they wanted to visit King Jonah's kingdom. So they knocked on the gates, and at the gates, there was a drawbridge and a river under it. The drawbridge was like a troll bridge, but with strings at the end that you could pull up and down. The strings were made of dental floss, but there was so much dental floss all wrapped together that the drawbridge was very strong.

After the kid knocked on the door to Jonah's kingdom, Jonah told his people to lower the troll bridge. They turned a wheel in a playground, and the drawbridge went over the river. Then the kid went over the bridge and entered Jonah's kingdom.

King Jonah asked, "Why are you here?" The kid said he wanted to explore the kingdom, and Jonah agreed. The first thing the kid saw was that all the children could drive Power Wheels in the streets, and no real cars were allowed. Grownups had to sit in the back seat of the Power Wheels in a special grownup seat. The Power Wheels were a little bigger because they had to fit grownups in the back. Whenever grownups wanted to go somewhere in Jonah's kingdom, a kid would have to drive them in the Power Wheels.

The kid who entered the kingdom said, "Wow, I've never seen a kingdom where all the kids could drive Power Wheels and none of the adults could drive real cars." Jonah pointed to a flying bicycle passing by the kingdom.

The kid thought the kingdom was very special, and Jonah told him that if he wanted to go to the pet store, he could follow him. Jonah drove his special king Power Wheels, which had a crown in front and looked like the Batmobile from Batman. It made a sound like a lion when you stepped on the pedal to go faster.

King Jonah drove the kid and his palace guards to the pet store. The pet store had a unique door on the roof. To get in, kids had to say "playground appear," climb a climbing structure, and slide down an elephant trunk-like slide with a little water in it.

Inside the pet store, there were many unusual pets, like colorful ant dinosaurs. The kid asked if he could take a sparkly, rainbow-colored T-Rex ant back to his kingdom, and Jonah agreed. He gave the kid a special container with holes, grass, and dirt for the T-Rex ant's journey.

Jonah then showed the kid invisible animals that could turn into real butterflies. The kid put on special invisible glasses and saw frogs jumping through the air, turning into real frogs.

But it was getting late, and everyone in the kingdom needed to eat. So Jonah told the boy they needed to leave the pet store and come back another time. The boy decided to stay in the kingdom for another night. King Jonah, the little boy, and everyone in the kingdom lived happily ever after. The end.
