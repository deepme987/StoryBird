Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Daphne. Daphne was born with special powers, but not everyone knew about them or believed her. As a child, Daphne knew she was going to be something special when she grew up, and she always wondered what her adventure would be.

One day, while Daphne was playing with her friends at a playground, she went down a slide. At the bottom of the slide, she noticed a new rock that had never been there before. The rock looked a bit like an egg, but much bigger. Daphne tried to pick up the rock, but it was too heavy for her. So, she asked her mom for help.

Daphne told her mom she had a great idea for lifting the heavy rock. She said it was too big for a regular person to lift, so they needed to dig a small hole under the rock. Then, they would squirt water from a hose into the hole. If they used maximum power, the water would push the rock up.

Daphne attached a hose to a nearby faucet and started digging the hole. Soon, the rock began to move, and to everyone's surprise, it started moving around! This was the moment Daphne had been waiting for - the magical thing she knew she would one day do. It turned out the rock wasn't really a rock; it was an ancient turtle. The turtle was so old that its shell was made of real rock. It was the strongest kind of turtle in the world - a lava turtle.

Lava turtles were a type of turtle that lived during dinosaur times. Most of them aren't around anymore, but if you look near playgrounds and check out the rocks for special patterns, you might find an old lava turtle.

These turtles only wake up if certain kids with magic powers come near them, and Daphne was one of those kids. So, the turtle got up out of the ground, revealing that it wasn't really a rock. Its special shell allowed it to go deep into the ground, all the way to the center of the Earth, and even under volcanoes into the magma.

Lava turtles are very sneaky, which is why they're hard to find. If they see people coming, they'll dig little holes and hide. There was a story Daphne had heard when she was little about an explorer who found a lava turtle at the North Pole. When the turtle saw the explorer, it went under the snow and traveled through the Earth all the way to the South Pole.

Daphne didn't want this turtle to leave, so she asked her friends to give it some space. Then, she had an idea: she would offer the turtle some candy. Since the turtle was from dinosaur times, it had probably never eaten candy before. Daphne asked her mom for some Gummy Bears and placed them in front of the turtle. The turtle revealed its rainbow-colored head and legs and began eating the gummy bears.

The turtle then asked Daphne if she wanted a ride, and with her mom's permission, Daphne climbed onto the turtle's back. The lava turtle told Daphne about a secret underground lake beneath the playground where a mermaid lived. Together, they went down into the secret lake.

In the underground cave, there were glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and a king holding a big fork in the water. Mermaids danced around, and there seemed to be a bubble bath factory in the distance. Pipes connected to all the houses, allowing the mermaids to travel wherever they wanted through the underground caves.

Daphne asked the turtle if this was true, and the turtle whistled. All the mermaids came over and told Daphne she was special. They sang a magical song that made Daphne's voice a little magical too.

The mermaids knew Daphne's family would be waiting for her, so they said she could come back another day. Daphne climbed back onto the lava turtle, and they returned to the playground. The turtle turned back into a rock, and Daphne promised to visit the turtle and the mermaids again someday. Daphne and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
