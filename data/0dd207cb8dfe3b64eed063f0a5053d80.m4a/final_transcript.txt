Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two girls named Bryn and Juliana. They lived in a house in Merrick, New York. One day, their mom told them she had an important secret to share. "Juliana, Bryn, are you ready for this big secret?" she asked. Both girls said yes, eager to hear it. Their mom revealed that they were secretly princesses! She had kept it a secret since they were born because their real castle wasn't ready for them yet. And inside the castle, there was nothing but cookie dough!

Bryn and Juliana thought their mom was joking. How could they be princesses? They were just regular girls living in Merrick, New York. But their mom showed them a picture from when they were babies. In the picture, baby Bryn and baby Juliana were in front of a pink castle, with a horse that had a star and a gold chain. The girls asked if their mom was tricking them, but she assured them it was true.

Soon, there was a knock on the door. Instead of the usual knock, knock, knock, it sounded like a doorbell: ding, ding, ding. Bryn and Juliana opened the door and saw a talking dog dressed like a person! The dog said it came from a secret kingdom deep in the forest, far from New York. The kingdom was missing its ruler, and the dog asked if Bryn and Juliana would go with it, along with their parents, to the kingdom.

A chariot arrived, pulled by two horses. It had big wheels and a door to step inside. There were special princess seats for Juliana and Bryn. They got into the chariot, and the horse with the star and gold chain started pulling them, along with their mom, to the secret kingdom. They passed by regular streets and saw a pond blocking their way. The talking dog barked, and the water in the pond rose up into a cloud, leaving the pond empty. The chariot then went into the empty, dry lake.

At the end of the lake, there was a tunnel going underground, under the forest, to the other side where the Magic Kingdom was. The tunnel had strawberry lights that, when turned on, looked like strawberries. If left on for too long, strawberry juice would drip from the ceiling, and Bryn and Juliana would open their mouths to drink it.

When they reached the other side of the tunnel, they saw the Magic Castle in the kingdom without a ruler. The castle was made of mirrors, but they didn't show regular reflections. Instead, the mirrors showed whoever you wanted to see and what they were doing. Bryn and Juliana looked in the Magic Castle and saw their dad being silly at home, walking upside down on his hands and almost falling.

The magic mirror also told them they could turn into anyone they wanted. They decided to turn into their mom, and their mom would turn into a little kid. After transforming, their mom, now a child, looked into the mirror and said, "Pizza! I want some pizza!" A big pizza started coming out of the mirror, growing bigger the more they looked at it. The whole wall in the castle turned into a giant pizza, spinning like a clock.

Bryn and Juliana decided to share the pizza with everyone in the kingdom since they didn't have a ruler. They opened the castle door and told all the people and animals in the magic kingdom they could each have two pieces of pizza. Everyone, including kitty cats, doggies, sheep, owls, squirrels, and even an elephant named Mumu, lined up to get their pizza from Princess Juliana and Princess Bryn.

As it got late, Bryn and Juliana turned back into kids using the mirror, and their mom turned back into an adult. They all went back home and lived happily ever after. The end.
