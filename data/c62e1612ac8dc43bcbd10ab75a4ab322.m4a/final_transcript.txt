Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Arabella. Arabella lived in Brisbane, Australia, in a house filled with paintings. Some of the paintings had pictures of people, and one of them had a picture of an old-fashioned car. The car was rainbow-colored, with blue wheels and big wings that came out of the doors and could flap.

Arabella had never seen a car like that in real life. But one day, while walking by a playground with her mom and dad, she saw the old-fashioned car from the picture in her house. It was in the parking lot next to the playground, with its rainbow colors, colorful wheels, and wings growing out of the doors. Music was playing from the car's radio, and it sounded like old-fashioned music.

Excited, Arabella told her parents she wanted to go closer to the old-fashioned rainbow-colored car to see why it was there and if it really matched the car in their painting. So they walked away from the slides, past the swings, and past the climbing structure towards the parking lot. As they got closer, they heard the music playing, and it sounded like kitty cats singing in the old-fashioned car's song.

The car door opened by itself, and there was nobody inside. Arabella asked her parents if it was a self-driving car from the old days. Her parents explained that they had a picture of this old-fashioned car because it was the kind of car everyone in the world had been looking for. It had been missing for a long time, having vanished from the old days when people used horses and special bicycles to get around. This car had escaped to the future.

Newspaper articles, magazines, TV shows, and radio announcers talked about the old-fashioned car that escaped to the future. That's why Arabella's parents had a picture of it in their house – it was big news. And now they had found it near the playground. Arabella saw the open doors and asked her parents if they could go inside the rainbow-colored car with wings and colorful wheels.

Her parents said that whoever found the rainbow-colored old-fashioned car got to go in it and become the new owner because that was the rule everyone in the world agreed on. So Arabella and her parents went inside the car. As soon as Arabella sat in the driver's seat, a car seat magically appeared. She invited her mom and dad to join her in the magical rainbow old-fashioned car that played old-fashioned kitty cat music.

They closed the doors, put on their seatbelts, and Arabella said, "Go, car, go." The car started to go backward through time, even before the time it came from. It went so far back that it reached the time when bees buzzed everywhere, and dinosaurs ruled the earth.

The dinosaurs living in that time were half pretend and half real. Some looked like dinosaur dolls or just like skeletons and bones you might see in a museum. But there were also real dinosaurs that weren't made of playdough or Silly Putty. These real dinosaurs made silly sounds and didn't move around much because they were so big and needed to save their energy.

The dinosaurs were surprised to see a rainbow-colored car because they had never seen a car or people before. They all crowded around the car, and Arabella could see that some were pretend, some were just bones, and some were really real. She decided to play the kitty cat music from the car, and as it started to sing "Meow, meow, meow," the dinosaurs got really happy and started to dance. They swung their necks, stomped their feet, and tried to clap, but it was silly because they weren't good at lifting their front feet. Some fell over and tried to do a silly breakdance on the ground.

Arabella thought the show was funny, and some of the dinosaurs really loved her and her parents because they had never met people before. One little dinosaur asked Arabella if it could become her pet and go with her in the rainbow-colored car back to the future. Arabella asked her parents, and they worried about what would happen if the dinosaur went to the future and died because dinosaurs weren't alive anymore. Arabella suggested that if the dinosaur went in the rainbow-colored car, it could escape the meteor that killed the dinosaurs and they could save it. Her dad agreed it was a good idea.

So Arabella took the baby dinosaur in the rainbow-colored old-fashioned car, and they all sat down with their seatbelts on. Arabella closed her eyes and said, "Go. Go, future." The rainbow-colored car spun its colorful wheels all the way into the future, and the baby dinosaur survived.

From that day on, Arabella became the only person in the world with a pet dinosaur. Arabella and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
