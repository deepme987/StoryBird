Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a kid named Jonah. One morning, Jonah woke up and realized that his bed wasn't in his room. His bed was right on the ground, and he was outside! He didn't know what happened, but during the night, his house disappeared. And right when he got up and took off his blanket, he saw some trolls. The trolls were kind of small, with hair all over their faces and coming out of their noses. They also had hair growing in their ears. The trolls were all around Jonah's bunk bed, and some of them were lifting it up, carrying it away.

Jonah took off his blanket and looked down at the trolls. One of the trolls looked at Jonah and said, "Shh." Jonah didn't know if he should talk or not, but he decided to jump off the top of the bunk bed and make his escape when the trolls turned a corner between some trees. So, Jonah threw his blanket on top of the trolls, held onto his pillows, and jumped off the top bunk bed. When he landed on the ground, it kind of hurt his leg a little bit. He saw the trolls turning around, and some of them had escaped from under the blanket. They started to chase him, so Jonah threw his pillow at the trolls and ran as fast as he could through the forest.

In the middle of the forest, Jonah saw a big obstacle. There was a wall surrounded by mud, with a pokey fence on one side that would give a big shock if touched, and a bunch of pointy knives on the other side. Jonah ran straight to the wall and started to climb over it. He got all muddy because of the dirt and mud at the bottom of the wall. When he reached the top, he almost slipped but managed to get to the other side. He thought he was safe because the trolls were too small to climb over the wall. But then he saw the trolls climbing on top of each other's shoulders, making themselves three levels high to go over the wall. The muddy trolls continued to chase Jonah.

Jonah saw a stick in the forest, so he picked it up and started running with it. As he ran, he heard the howling of some wolves. Jonah ran away from the howls because he didn't want to run into a wolf trap. But the howling got closer and closer, and suddenly, a bunch of wolves surrounded him. The trolls were getting close too, and the wolves were barking really loudly. Jonah used his stick and swung it around, bopping any wolf that got too close on the nose. Soon, the wolves became scared of Jonah and realized that he should be in charge of them because he could do things they couldn't do. The lead wolf decided to sit, and Jonah lifted his hand, making the wolf stand up. Then, Jonah threw his hand in the air and made it go back down, and the lead wolf jumped up and down. The other wolves started to copy, and Jonah pointed in the direction of the trolls. All of the wolves listened to Jonah and started attacking the trolls, who ran away in fear.

Jonah was finally safe at last, with the pack of wolves that he was initially afraid of now helping him. But he still didn't know how to get out of the forest. That night, Jonah slept in the dark next to the wolves. One of the wolves even let Jonah sleep on its tummy as a pillow, keeping him warm with its fur. The next morning, Jonah woke up to find all the wolves waiting for him to lead them somewhere. So, Jonah started walking through the forest, trying to find a river. He knew that if he could find a river and follow it, he could find water, fish, and maybe even people.

Jonah followed the river, knowing that sometimes it could lead to a waterfall. And that's exactly what happened. The wolves followed him as he tried to find a city or something that the river might lead to, but he saw that the river just led to a big waterfall. Jonah was cornered next to the waterfall with the wolves and thought he might have to turn back when suddenly a grizzly bear appeared. The grizzly bear was angry because it was a mama bear with her two cubs, and she thought the wolves might be trying to take her babies. The wolves started to circle around the grizzly bear and her cubs.

Then, Jonah punched backward, and the wolves knew what this meant. They stopped circling around the grizzly bear and instead made a line in front of it, between the bear and Jonah. This way, the mama grizzly bear had a chance to retreat with her cubs away from the edge of the waterfall. The grizzly bear started to move backward but almost fell off the cliff by the waterfall. Jonah told one of the wolves to bark, which distracted the grizzly bear and saved it from falling. The grateful grizzly bear decided to join Jonah and the wolves.

Jonah, the pack of wolves, and the grizzly bear went away from the waterfall and followed the river through the forest on that fateful day. You might ask what happened next, but the story is getting a little bit too long, so I'll have to keep that a secret for now. Maybe we'll find out in another story! Good night, and the end.
