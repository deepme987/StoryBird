Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Kaden. Kaden was a little bit bored at home because there were no toys to play with. So Kaden told his grandma, "Grandma, there are no toys and nothing to do in the house." His grandma replied, "Well, what about the toy fire truck?" Kaden said, "Well, I'm just too bored to play with that right now." His grandma suggested, "How about we go to the pool and swim?" Kaden agreed that it was a good idea.

So Kaden and his grandma drove to the pool. Kaden decided to bring some special snacks, including cookies. When they arrived at the pool, Kaden and his grandma were ready to swim. But guess what they saw in the pool? There were fish! Usually, fish are found in lakes, oceans, or rivers, but not in swimming pools. However, this pool was full of special fish with arms and legs. They were such silly fish!

Kaden's grandma asked, "Kaden, are you sure you still want to swim in this pool even though there are fish with arms and legs?" Kaden replied, "Yeah, how about you come into the pool with me, grandma?" His grandma agreed, but Kaden was worried she might sink because she was old. His grandma had an idea and brought a floatie with her. Kaden and his grandma started floating in the water when suddenly, one of the fish swam up to them and began climbing Kaden's legs.

Usually, fish can't climb legs because they don't have hands and feet. But this was a Mexican walking fish, a kind of fish that does have hands and feet. The fish said hello and walked up Kaden's legs onto the floatie. The fish explained, "I always wanted to go on a floatie because I always have to swim all by myself, and I just wanted to relax." Kaden asked his grandma if the fish could join them, and she agreed. So the fish stayed on the floatie, and the wind blew them to the edge of the pool.

When they reached the edge, the fish asked if it could hop out of the pool and walk on the ground. Kaden asked his grandma, "Is that a good idea? I thought fish could only breathe in the water." His grandma replied, "Well, maybe this is a magical fish." So Kaden told the fish it was okay, and the fish used its arms and legs to climb out of the pool and walk on the ground.

The fish told Kaden it was hungry and wanted to eat something yummy. It saw Kaden's cookies and asked to share them. Kaden agreed, and they both started eating cookies. As they ate, they saw a robot coming, going bump, bump, beep, bump. Kaden wondered if the robot would take their snacks away. The fish reassured him, "Oh, don't worry, Kaden. That robot's my friend. It's going to bring a special treat for us." Kaden asked, "Oh, what's the special treat?"

The robot approached them and said, "I am a robot. I have a special thing inside my robot belly button. Do you want to press the button?" The fish told Kaden to press the button, and the robot's belly would open up to reveal what was inside. Kaden pressed the green button, and the robot announced, "My belly is opening up. Now you're going to see something inside." The robot's belly doors opened, and inside was a kitty cat. But this kitty cat had flippers and looked like it could swim underwater, like a mermaid cat.

The mermaid cat jumped out of the robot, ate some cookies, and then jumped into the pool. It swam to the bottom, and Kaden exclaimed, "Hey, I didn't know a kitty cat could eat cookies and go to the bottom of the pool. Let's catch it!" The Mexican walking fish agreed, and Kaden and the fish dove into the pool, telling grandma to wait on the floatie.

Kaden swam underwater, holding his breath, and saw something amazing. There were many kitty cats with mermaid flippers swimming at the bottom of the pool. The pool floor was full of kitty treats and turkey, which the kitties were eating. There were also holes that looked like where mice might live. Kaden was amazed to find kitty cats, mice, and walking fish underwater.

Kaden swam back up and told his grandma, "Grandma, guess what? There are lots of kitty cats underwater, not just the one from the robot!" His grandma wanted to see, so she dove underwater and saw the kitties. She proposed, "How about we try to catch one of the kitty cats and one of the mice to take home? We can also ask the robot and the walking fish to come with us."

Kaden told the kitty cats that if they came home with him, he would take good care of them. They asked where they could stay, and Kaden suggested the kitchen sink. He promised to share pretzels, candy, and cookies with them and let his friends come over to see the special kitties. The magical kitty cat agreed.

Kaden's grandma drove them home, where they had a special bathtub and sink for the kitty, walking fish, and robot. Kaden took great care of his new pets, and all his friends were jealous and wanted to visit. Kaden and his grandma lived happily ever after. The end.
