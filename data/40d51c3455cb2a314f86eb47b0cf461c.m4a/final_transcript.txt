Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a seven-year-old boy named Max. It was getting late, and Max's mom was tucking him into bed. Max had his pajamas on, and he was lying down in his bed, feeling very tired. Max closed his eyes, and his mom left the room. It was time for Max to go to sleep.

After Max's mom left the room, Max saw some shadows on his wall. They looked like shadows that his mom couldn't see because she wasn't in the room. The shadows looked like shark shadows, swimming on the wall with fins and sharp teeth. Max wasn't sure if they were scary or not.

Just as Max was wondering if these were nice sharks or mean sharks, his room filled up with water, and Max discovered he could breathe underwater. The way Max could breathe underwater was by holding some air in his cheeks and making bubbles. Whenever he wanted to breathe, he would use the air he saved up in his cheeks. This doesn't work in real life, but in make-believe stories, it's a fun way to swim through water.

The shark was also swimming through the water, and it came up to Max and said it was a nice shark. Max asked the shark why it came into his room and why his room filled up with water. The shark said its name was Simon and that it came from a different universe where sharks could also fly. In that universe, sharks had wings and could fly with dinosaurs, like pterodactyls.

In the olden days, before people were alive, sharks were used as flying taxis. If an animal, like a deer or a frog, needed a ride to go far away but couldn't fit on a bird, they would ride on a shark bird. Shark birds were the biggest birds to ever live.

In the days of dinosaurs and shark birds, when animals needed to travel far and there were no cars, they would take shark bird rides. There were some birds that could also be used as taxis, but there weren't many because birds didn't like giving rides. However, these sharks were friendly sharks.

Simon the shark told Max that he swam into his room, and his room filled up with water because Max's room went back in time while he was falling asleep. Max asked where his parents were and where everyone else was. The friendly shark told Max that they could just swim through the underwater ice cube volcano, which was very cold. If anyone touched the ice from this volcano, they would instantly become a snowman.

As Max was riding the friendly shark past the ice cube volcano, he saw that his parents were selling pizzas in this underwater universe. The people there still ate pizza, but it was underwater pizza that didn't get wet. There was an underwater pizza oven that used hot lava from a regular volcano.

Max didn't know how his house went back in time, so the shark told him that as he was falling asleep, a genie's shadow appeared on his wall. The genie secretly went into Max's room after his mom left and whispered something that Max heard only a little bit. That sound made Max and his room go back to the olden days when there were flying sharks, dinosaurs, and underwater ice volcanoes.

As Max was looking for his parents in this different universe, he saw a choo-choo train that went underwater and had pizza wheels. Max thought genies weren't real, but he saw the genie's shadow, which was magical.

While flying on the shark past the ice cube volcano and watching the pizza choo-choo train go on the underwater tracks made of lollipop sticks, Max found his parents. They were in a big building under the ocean, swinging on swings at the top of the building. Max asked his parents what they were doing in this universe, and they told him that he had fallen asleep and this was all a dream.

Max opened his eyes and woke up to see his parents right next to him with a piece of candy. Max ate the candy and lived happily ever after. The end.
