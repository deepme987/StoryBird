Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two girls named Addie and Lucy. Every day in the morning, Addie and Lucy's mom made some eggs for breakfast. Sometimes, Addie and Lucy's mom let them help scramble the eggs, and they even got to mix it around in the pan.

One special morning, when Addie and Lucy got out of bed for breakfast, they saw an egg waiting for them to crack. They took the egg out of the carton, and with their mama's help, they cracked it open. But instead of a regular egg with a yellow yolk and white stuff, a baby dinosaur came out of the egg!

The baby dinosaur was green, with green wings, and a long green face with big dinosaur teeth. The baby dinosaur yawned and said, "Addie, Lucy, thanks for setting me free. I was stuck in that chicken egg, but I was really a baby dinosaur egg." Addie and Lucy told their mom, and she came over to see the little green flying dinosaur that could turn into anything. The dinosaur introduced himself as Denny.

Denny the dinosaur was very special and could help them do whatever they wanted. If the kids needed help, like grabbing a plate or pouring orange juice, Denny the dinosaur was there to help. He could even go to the store and get a cake!

Denny the Dinosaur had a special trick. When he ate pink sugar, he could change into anything that Addie wanted. So Addie and Lucy poured some pink sugar on a plate, and Denny ate it. He turned into a unicorn with a big horn, rainbow colors, and unicorn wings. Instead of regular unicorn legs, he had magic wands for legs!

The unicorn walked around the kitchen, saying, "I want oatmeal." Addie and Lucy said they could get him oatmeal, but the unicorn went to their bathroom, turned on the bathtub, and oatmeal came out! The bathtub filled with oatmeal, and Addie, Lucy, and the unicorn jumped in and started eating it.

Suddenly, a tornado came and blew away their house. Luckily, the unicorn was still in the bathtub with Addie, Lucy, and their mom, and everyone was safe. The bathtub became a swing, attached to a big tree, and it rocked back and forth. Magical animals like butterflies, birds with helicopter propellers, and fireflies that lit up with ice instead of fire came to join them.

Addie and Lucy asked the unicorn to make their house reappear. The unicorn turned into a weatherman, brought back good weather, and their house rebuilt itself. All their toys returned, and the bathtub went back to its place. Addie and Lucy's mom asked what they were doing, and they told her the story of the unicorn, the oatmeal bath, and the tornado.

Addie and Lucy decided to ask their magical green dinosaur to turn into a kitty cat. The green dinosaur turned into the cutest, cuddliest, friendliest kitty cat in the whole world, and they kept it as their pet. Addie and Lucy lived happily ever after. The end.
