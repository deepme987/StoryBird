Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Jasper. Jasper was very lucky because one day, while walking on the sidewalk, he found a hamster. He asked his mom if he could catch the hamster and bring it home as a pet so that he could feed it. Jasper's mom agreed, and Jasper used a butterfly net to catch the hamster gently. He wanted to take the hamster home to feed him, take care of him, and pet him. So, Jasper and his mom brought the hamster home, and Jasper put it in a cozy hamster cage with special toys for the hamster to play with.

One day, Jasper woke up and looked at the hamster cage on top of his dresser. To his surprise, there was no hamster inside! Instead, there was a tiny cheetah, the same size as a hamster. Jasper wondered if the hamster had eaten a magical fruit he had put in the cage, which turned it into a little cheetah. The magic fruit tasted like strawberry on the outside and ice cream on the inside.

Jasper decided to take the cheetah out of the cage. He picked it up gently and asked if it wanted to play. The cheetah agreed, so Jasper told it to race as fast as it could to the kitchen. The cheetah zoomed to the kitchen and back before Jasper's mom could even see. Jasper realized that the cheetah could help him do things quickly, like cleaning up.

So, Jasper made a big mess with his toys on the floor. His mom told him to clean up, but Jasper asked her to close her eyes for just two seconds. While she did, Jasper told the cheetah to clean up quickly. The cheetah did, and when Jasper's mom opened her eyes, all the toys were put away. She was amazed and asked Jasper how he did it. Jasper revealed the secret of the hamster turning into a cheetah after eating the magic fruit.

Jasper's mom wondered what would happen if they fed the cheetah more magic fruit. They gave the cheetah another piece, and it turned into a tiger! Jasper and his mom used the tiger to help them move heavy things, like their dining table. Then, they gave the tiger another magic fruit, and it turned into a leopard. The leopard gave Jasper and his mom rides all over town, even to the supermarket for grocery shopping.

After they returned home from grocery shopping, they gave the leopard one last magic fruit, and it turned back into a hamster. Jasper decided he would give it a different magic fruit another day. Jasper, his mom, and the special hamster lived happily ever after. The end.
