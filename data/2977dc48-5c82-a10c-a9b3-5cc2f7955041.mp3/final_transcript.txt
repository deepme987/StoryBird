Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a kid named Jesse. One day, Jesse's teacher said that all the kids should wear costumes to school. But Jesse's usual dinosaur costume was dirty, so he asked his mom to make a new one. His mom made a bunny rabbit costume, but the tail wasn't quite right. So she sewed on a long, fluffy white rope that looked like a jump rope. Then Jesse and his mom walked to school together.

When Jesse arrived at school, he saw that the fence around it was covered in glitter. There were green and red flashing lights on top of the school, and jars of candy lined the walkway. Inside, all of Jesse's friends were wearing costumes too. One friend was dressed as a doggie, and another as a kitty cat. Jesse felt a little sad because his costume wasn't as real as the others.

Jesse's teacher noticed and let him choose a candy first. He picked a KitKat from a magic hat. When he took a bite, his tail became real, and he got rabbit feet! Jesse started hopping around like a real rabbit.

One of Jesse's friends in the doggy costume wanted to try too. He took a bite of the KitKat and turned into a real doggie, barking "Woof, woof!" Soon, all the kids and even the teachers, who were dressed as witches, started eating candy and turning into animals.

Everyone was surprised by the magical candy, so they decided to have a dance party. The kids howled, hooted, and ran faster than ever before. But then, the dinosaur kid accidentally knocked over a bookshelf. The witch teacher waved her magic wand, and the books went right back on the shelf.

The kids wanted to see what Jesse could do as a bunny. He dug a hole in the floor, creating a tunnel that went underground. Everyone decided to play hide and seek, and the doggie friend found Jesse first because of his great sense of smell.

A kitty cat friend tried to catch Jesse, but he jumped high and got away. Jesse and the dinosaur teamed up so no one would catch them. The kids decided to build a tower with blocks, and Jesse used his jumping powers to place blocks higher than anyone else. But the dinosaur accidentally knocked it down, so the witch teacher fixed it with her magic wand.

Suddenly, it was time to go outside. The kids raced to the playground, accidentally knocking down a wall. Jesse jumped on the monkey bars, and they all had fun. But then, some squirrels wanted to play too and tried to use the playground equipment before the kids. That wasn't very nice.

The witch teacher decided it was time to turn everyone back into regular kids. She waved her magic wand, and all the kids turned back, still wearing their costumes. The squirrels saw that they were just kids and ran away.

For the rest of the day, Jesse and his friends had lots of fun. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
