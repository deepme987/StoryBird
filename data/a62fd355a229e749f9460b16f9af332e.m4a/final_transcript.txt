Once upon a time, there was a big boy named Xander. Xander had a lot of kids in his family. He had a younger brother named Louie and a baby sister named Cese. Xander loved to play in playgrounds so much. Sometimes his favorite part was the slides, and sometimes it was the swings. He and Louie would take turns playing on the playground. They also liked to play with toy cars and planes. Cese was just learning how to play.

One day, Xander told his parents that he and Louie wanted to see some dinosaur bones. Their mom said they would have to go on an adventure to hunt for dinosaur bones since the museums were closed. So Xander, Louie, Cese, and their parents decided to go on a big expedition. They packed their bags, brought some shovels, and even an extra toothbrush, and set out on their adventure. Their dad drove the car the most, and they drove until they reached a desert.

After they arrived at the desert, they decided to have a snack of gummy bears. Their dad said they would go on a little hike while they ate the gummy bears. As they hiked and ate gummy bears, Cese started to cry. So Louie suggested they take a break. While Cese was crying, they all decided to stop walking and enjoy their yummy gummy bears. Some were green, and some were red. As they sat eating the gummy bears, Cese stopped crying. Cese's mom asked if they should keep going, and Xander said no because there was something under the rock his mom was sitting on.

Everyone looked, and under the rock was a big dinosaur bone sticking out. They could only see the tip of it, but it looked so big that they knew it went deep underground. Xander's dad said they had found their first dinosaur bone and they should start digging. He used a grown-up shovel, while Xander and Louie used smaller shovels. They dug a big hole, bigger than a person, to reach the bottom of the dinosaur bone.

It was a good thing that their mom brought some rope because they used it to climb down into the hole. When they reached the bottom, they saw that the dinosaur bone was so big, it was bigger than three people. They pulled the dinosaur bone out of the hole with the rope and attached the other end to their dad's car. The car pulled the dinosaur bone out of the hole and onto the side of the trail.

After the dinosaur bone was out, Louie spotted something blue under it. Xander saw that it was an egg, but not like a chicken egg or an egg you eat for breakfast. This was a huge blue egg. Cese looked at the egg and said, "Blue, blue." Their mom said they had found a dinosaur egg. Xander and Louie were surprised because they thought all dinosaurs were extinct. Their dad said maybe this egg was left undiscovered.

They decided to bring the egg out of the hole, using the rope again because it was too heavy to lift. Once the egg was out, they tried putting some extra gummy bears on top of it to see if it would hatch. They put a red one, a green one, and a blue one, but nothing happened. Then Louie suggested they try putting rainbow-colored sprinkles on the egg. Xander and Louie took turns throwing sprinkles on the egg, and it hatched into a baby dinosaur!

The baby dinosaur was small and not scary, but still as big as Xander. It could talk and said its name was Hula Belu. Xander and Louie introduced themselves, and Hula Belu said it was nice to meet them. The dinosaur was hungry for gummy bears, so they showed it where the extra gummy bears were, and it ate them up. Hula Belu said it liked to give dinosaur rides, so Xander and Louie took turns riding the dinosaur through the desert trail.

After the rides, Hula Belu wanted to see where it hatched. Xander and Louie showed the dinosaur its blue eggshell. Hula Belu noticed an earthworm next to the egg and asked if they could help get it out. Xander, Louie, and their dad climbed back into the hole and picked up the worm. Hula Belu said dinosaurs love to be friends with worms and have a magical way to make them grow by sneezing on them. The dinosaur sneezed on the worm, and it became a colorful, talking worm. Xander and Louie even got to ride the worm, but Cese was too young.

They started to head back home because they needed to find a place for Hula Belu to live and eat. On their way back, they saw a big dragonfly that liked to be near Hula Belu. The dinosaur said it was lonely and would be happy to have the dragonfly's company. They decided their adventure was over because they had found dinosaur bones and a real dinosaur from an egg.

Hula Belu said it wanted to see its mama and would grow wings to fly to a different planet to find other dinosaurs. Xander, Louie, Cese, and their parents went back to their car and drove home. They always told stories of the time they had an amazing adventure where they found a dinosaur bone and a blue dinosaur egg that hatched into a dinosaur. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
