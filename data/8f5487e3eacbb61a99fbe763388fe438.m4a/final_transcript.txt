Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Antra. It was raining outside, and Antra looked out the window. She saw something very interesting - a rainbow! But this rainbow was black, white, and gray. It stretched across the sky, so big and beautiful, but without any colors. On one side of the rainbow, there were trees in a faraway forest. On the other side, in the middle, there was a lake. Antra called her mom to come, and when she did, Antra pointed at the black, white, and gray rainbow and asked, "Mom, have you ever seen a rainbow without any colors before?" Her mom said she hadn't.

They decided to put on their rainboots and go outside to walk all the way to the black, white, and gray rainbow to see what was there. As they walked down the street, they stepped in lots of puddles. The puddles were very silly because every time you stepped in one, it splashed and made new puddles wherever the splash went. The puddles came in colors - some were gray, some were white, and some were black. Antra and her mom walked all the way to the lake where the black, white, and gray rainbow ended.

When they got to the lake, they saw a mermaid. The mermaid had no colors, just like the rainbow. She looked like she was from a cartoon on a computer. The mermaid asked Antra, "Are you here because you saw the black, white, and gray rainbow in the sky?" Antra told the mermaid that she and her mom came to see what was at the end of the rainbow. The mermaid explained that the black, white, and gray rainbow ended in the middle of the lake, where many different mermaids lived. The reason the rainbow had no colors was because all the colors poured out of the rainbow and went under the water into the lake where the mermaids lived.

The black, white, and gray mermaid said she would jump into the magic water and turn into a colorful mermaid again. She jumped in, and when she came out, she looked like a regular, colorful mermaid. Other mermaids started to jump out from the water under the black, white, and gray rainbow. They swam and did all sorts of colorful tricks. Some had hula hoops and danced around, flipping up and down in the water. Antra said, "Mom, look, the mermaids are so colorful now."

Just then, lots of bees flew to the lake. They started going in a circle around the middle of the lake, and they all became colorful bees, dancing in circles. Then, a bunch of pigeons came. When the pigeons flew to the middle of the lake, right by the black, white, and gray rainbow, they turned into colorful parrots.

Antra said, "Mom, it's so nice that the mermaids, bees, and everything else could get colorful. But it's not fair to the rainbow that it has no color. How about we ask a mermaid to help put the color back in the rainbow?" Antra's mom asked a mermaid, who agreed. She said they needed help because it was easy to take the color out of a rainbow, but harder to put it back in.

The mermaid said they needed someone who could do cartwheels, somersaults, and cool jumps - someone with gymnast powers. Antra asked how she could get gymnast powers, and the mermaid said she had to hold her mom's hand, dip her toes in the water, and they would get colorful nail polish and gymnast powers. Antra did as the mermaid said, and her toes got colorful rainbow nail polish.

With her new gymnast powers, Antra jumped from the side of the lake to the middle, landing on a mermaid's tail. The mermaid flipped up some rainbow color from the lake, and Antra pushed it back up into the rainbow. She did this for all the colors, with the mermaids helping her. Antra did hops, jumps, and even a backflip as she put the colors back into the black, white, and gray rainbow.

Antra was so proud of her gymnast powers. When she got back to shore, she saw the rainbow was colorful again. The rainbow even had little eyes and a mouth that said, "Thank you." Antra was the first person a rainbow ever thanked. The mermaids, bees, and parrots-turned-pigeons were all so happy.

The parrots flew in a line, following Antra and her mom all the way back to their house in Mumbai, India. Everyone in Mumbai had a big party for Antra because she made the black, white, and gray rainbow colorful again. Antra and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
