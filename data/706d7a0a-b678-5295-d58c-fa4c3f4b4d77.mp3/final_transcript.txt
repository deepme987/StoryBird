Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. One day, they were playing in a playground and found a slide that was like a tube. They went down the slide, and at the very bottom, they discovered a golden remote control. Jesse picked it up and showed it to his mom. But when he accidentally pressed the up button, his mom started floating in the air! That's when Jesse knew he found a magical remote control that could control people.

Jonah told Jesse to press the down button so his mom would come back to the ground. Jesse did, and his mom, Amanda, landed safely. Jonah asked Jesse if he could see how the remote worked. Jesse handed it to him, and Jonah noticed some squirrels running on a tree nearby. Jesse warned Jonah not to point at the squirrels, but it was too late. Jonah pressed the off button, and the squirrels fell from the tree, lifeless.

Jonah didn't mean to hurt the squirrels, so he pointed the golden remote at them and pressed the power button. The squirrels came back to life and scampered back up the tree. Jesse and Jonah realized they had a powerful remote control and decided to do cool things with it.

On their way home, they passed a cemetery, and Jonah pointed the remote at some graves, pressing the power button. Suddenly, skeletons rose from the ground and started walking around. Jesse quickly took the remote and meant to press the off button, but he accidentally pressed the up button instead. The skeletons started floating and chasing after Jonah, Jesse, and their parents, Steve and Amanda.

Jonah grabbed the remote and pressed the off button, making the skeletons fall back down. Jesse and Jonah knew they had to be careful with the golden remote. They decided to use it for good things, like making candy float at a candy store. The store owner and kids loved it!

One night, Jesse and Jonah misplaced the remote control. The next day, they found their parents floating, and their kitty cat had the remote! The kitty made Jonah and Jesse float, too, and even put leashes on them. The kitty controlled them with the remote, and they didn't know what to do.

Jonah whispered a secret plan to Jesse, but the kitty heard it and gave Jonah a time-out. Jesse had to think of a plan by himself. He decided to get some kitty treats and asked the kitty if he could pet it. While petting the kitty, Jesse sneakily grabbed the remote and pressed the pause button, freezing the kitty.

Jesse freed himself and Jonah, and they found their parents locked in their bedroom. Jonah pressed play, and his parents could move again. They had to figure out what to do with the kitty, who was usually nice. Jesse and Jonah decided to hide the remote far away so no one could use it.

They went with their family to a remote part of New Zealand and hid the golden remote control. If you ever visit New Zealand's South Island, keep an eye out for a golden remote that can control people and animals! Jesse, Jonah, the kitty cat, and their parents lived happily ever after. The end.
