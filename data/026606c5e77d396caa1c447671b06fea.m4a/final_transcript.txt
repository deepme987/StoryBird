Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big kid named Kaipo. Kaipo and his sibling, Nahale, lived on a big farm. The farm they lived on was really special because there were pigs, goats, sheep, and a big apple tree. Kaipo and Nahale loved to climb the apple tree because it was perfect for kids to climb. If you got to the top, you could pick an apple. Most of the apples were regular apples, but some had honey inside, and Kaipo and Nahale loved those honey-filled apples.

One day, while Kaipo and Nahale were climbing the apple tree, they saw an apple fall to the ground. When the apple fell, they looked around and saw a bear wearing a superhero cape. The bear was flying around the farm and landed right next to the apple tree. The bear picked up the fallen apple and started munching on it. Kaipo asked Nahale, "Should we be scared of the bear?" Nahale said no.

The bear told Kaipo and Nahale that he lived on top of the clouds and that's why he had a superhero cape. The bear also said that sometimes he liked to take kids for rides in the sky on top of the clouds. Kaipo told the bear that if they went for a ride, they would have to ask their dad, their papa. The bear agreed, so Kaipo and Nahale went back to the farmhouse and asked their papa, "Papa, can we go with the bear up to the sky because he has a cape and can fly?" Their father said okay, but they should also carry a toy rocket ship with them, just in case the superhero's cape stopped working. Kaipo and Nahale agreed.

So Kaipo found a new purple and pink rocket ship on top of his dresser and brought it outside. Kaipo told Nahale and the superhero bear that they were ready to go into the sky. The bear said okay, and since they didn't have seatbelts, they tied themselves onto the bear using shoelaces. Then, Kaipo held onto the purple and pink rocket ship, and they all said, "Off we go!" The bear started flying with his superhero cape and with Kaipo and Nahale attached, all the way up to the sky.

When they reached the clouds, they saw a disco ball and many dancing shadows on top of the clouds, but they couldn't really see who the shadows were. Kaipo and Nahale said, "How about we go to the dance party on top of the clouds?" The bear thought it sounded fun. He placed his superhero cape on the cloud so Kaipo and Nahale could step on it without falling through. As they stood on the cape, they saw the sun turn into a big disco ball with many colors. The disco ball sun spun around, and different colors flashed.

Suddenly, Kaipo and Nahale saw the bear playing the drums and singing a silly song. Kaipo found a guitar, so he and Nahale started playing it while the bear played the drums. The disco ball sun spun different colors around, and the dance party began. Many shadows danced with them in the clouds. One of the shadows looked like their mama, and it was a great dancer. Kaipo and Nahale had so much fun dancing with the magical shadow, who said, "I love to spend time with you and think about you all the time." They held hands and danced around, having a blast with the bear's silly drumming.

As they danced, apples started falling off the apple tree. But instead of falling down, the bear blew them up into the sky. Some apples fell up through the sky and onto the clouds. Kaipo and Nahale were having the biggest dance party ever when suddenly, Kaipo noticed the superhero bear's cape starting to slip. "Hurry, superhero bear!" he said. The bear quickly lit the rocket, and Kaipo and Nahale held onto it as it flew through the sky. The playful shadow joined them, and they had so much fun.

Soon, the superhero bear said it was time for Kaipo and Nahale to go back home. They said goodbye to all their friends and the shadows on top of the clouds. They promised to always remember to have fun and dance because it was so special. Kaipo and Nahale rode the rocket ship all the way down, and the superhero bear helped them land softly next to the apple tree where they started. When they got back, they saw their papa waiting for them. They excitedly told him about their adventure in the sky with the magical bear and the fun dance party with the shadows. Kaipo and Nahale lived happily ever after. The end.
