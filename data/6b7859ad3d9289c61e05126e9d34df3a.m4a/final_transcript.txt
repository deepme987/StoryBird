Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a three-year-old named Erin. Erin loved to wear special princess dresses, dance, and listen to music. But her favorite thing of all was eating popcorn. One day, Erin told her mom that they needed more popcorn because they had run out. Her mom said it wasn't snack time, so Erin became sad.

Erin looked in the refrigerator and saw there was no food - not even yogurt, blueberries, or strawberries. She asked her mom and dad to take her to the supermarket. When they arrived, Erin saw that all the shelves were empty, and there was no food in the supermarket. Erin, her mom, and her dad went to different stores, but there was no food anywhere. Something silly was going on.

Erin told her mom that it seemed like something silly was happening, and her mom agreed. Erin had an idea to get food from another planet with lots of grocery stores and bring it back to Earth. But she didn't have a rocket ship and needed help building one. Her mom said they didn't have any tools to build rocket ships, but Erin had another idea.

Her idea was to use a fallen tree and ask her dad to hollow it out, leaving just a circle around it. Then, they would build a compartment on top for her to sit in during the rocket ride. Erin also wanted windows to see the stars, the moon, and other planets. Her dad agreed, and for two days, Erin and her parents worked on turning the hollowed-out tree into a rocket ship. They made seats, storage units, and even spaces for beds and a special seat for her blue doll.

Erin told her parents that the rocket ship was almost ready, but it needed rocket fuel. They went to a store to buy rocket fuel, but they only found a microwave and some popcorn. Erin had a great idea - instead of using regular rocket fuel, they would use the microwave to pop popcorn, which would make the rocket ship go up. They named it the Popcorn Tree Rocket Ship.

Erin's friends came over and helped paint the rocket ship blue, like her dolly. They also painted rainbows, unicorns, and smiley faces on it. When it was finished, Erin and her parents put the microwave on the bottom and filled it with popcorn seeds. Erin went inside with her blue doll, and her friends counted down: three, two, one, blastoff!

As the popcorn popped, the rocket ship blasted off into the sky. Popcorn kept coming out, and everyone in the world could eat popcorn because there was so much. Erin went higher and higher until she reached outer space. She saw a red planet in the distance and wondered if it was Mars. Her blue doll said it wasn't Mars because it smelled yummy.

As they got closer, they saw something buzzing around the planet. Erin decided to land the rocket ship, and they touched down gently on the red planet. Erin and her dolly discovered a red river and waterfall made of strawberry juice. They drank the juice and radioed back to Earth, telling their friends about the delicious strawberry juice planet.

On this planet, there were no ants, roly polys, or caterpillars - only talking ladybugs. The ladybugs knew Erin's name because her blue dolly had told them. Erin asked the ladybugs to help her bring food back to Earth for the supermarkets. The ladybugs worked together to carry strawberries, yogurt, ice cream, and cookie dough to the rocket ship.

Erin thanked the ladybugs and promised to visit again. She blasted off in her Popcorn Tree Rocket Ship and returned to Earth. When she landed, everyone was waiting and happy to see her. Erin told them they could now fill the supermarkets with food, and if they ever ran out, she would go back to the other planet. Everyone cheered, calling Erin their hero, and she lived happily ever after. The end.
