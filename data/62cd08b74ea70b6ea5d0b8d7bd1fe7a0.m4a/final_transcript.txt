Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four-year-old girl named Lila. It was winter, and it was getting cold outside, but Lila was hungry, and she really wanted a popsicle. So Lila went to the store with her mom, and she asked her mom if she could get a popsicle. Lila's mom said, "Okay." Lila looked through the freezer in the store, where they kept the popsicles. She saw ice cream and some yummy popsicles, and she chose a big, red frozen popsicle with sugar in it.

Lila's mom told her to wait until they got home to open the popsicle because it had a wrapper on it. So they drove back to Lila's house. When they got home, Lila asked, "Mom, can we open the popsicle now to see if it's yummy?" Lila's mom said, "Okay." They opened the popsicle and were very surprised to see what was inside. Instead of a regular popsicle, there was a baby dragon frozen inside!

Lila said, "Mom, look! I found a baby dragon in our popsicle." Lila's mom said, "Dragons don't like to be frozen because they breathe fire, and fire is hot. We need to defrost the popsicle to see if the dragon can come back to life." Lila asked, "How are we going to do that?" Lila's mom had an idea. They would put the popsicle on a white plate and place it in front of the heater in their house. The warm air from the heater would melt the popsicle, and the dragon would come out.

Lila did this, and soon the popsicle melted, and out came the baby dragon. The baby dragon was red and still alive, even after being frozen. The baby dragon said, "My name is Diggy the Dragon." Lila said, "Mom, the dragon is really talking!" Lila's mom looked and couldn't believe it because she had never seen a talking dragon before, especially one that came from a popsicle. Lila asked Diggy Dragon, "Where did you come from?" Diggy the Dragon told Lila that he came from inside a volcano. He explained that dragons are born inside volcanoes, and that's how they can breathe fire.

Diggy Dragon said he used to live in a volcano with lots of other dragons. It was a special volcano where many dragons lived. Diggy asked Lila if she wanted to visit the volcano, which was not far from Raleigh, North Carolina. Lila said it might not be safe for kids or adults to go to a volcano. Diggy assured her that this volcano hadn't erupted in 100 years. Lila asked her mom if it would be safe, and her mom agreed, but they would bring a car with four-wheel drive and binoculars to look at the volcano from a safe distance.

As they started their journey, Lila's mom put Lila in her car seat. Diggy Dragon sat in the front seat, wearing a seatbelt made of dental floss. On their way to the secret volcano, they saw a unicorn on the side of the road. The unicorn asked for help. Lila, her mom, and Diggy Dragon went to the unicorn, who said its nose was itchy and needed someone to scratch it. Diggy Dragon volunteered and gently scratched the unicorn's nose with his little dragon claws. The unicorn sneezed whipped cream, which dragons love to eat, so Diggy Dragon happily ate it up.

The unicorn thanked them and told Lila it was afraid of the dark. Lila suggested that the unicorn could join them if it could become a little unicorn. The unicorn said it needed a princess's help to do magic. Diggy Dragon told them there was a princess living nearby, and they found her behind some trees. The princess helped the unicorn become small enough to fit in the car.

As it was getting dark, Lila's mom said they would have to stop before reaching the volcano. They looked at the volcano from afar using their binoculars. Lila, her mom, Diggy Dragon, the unicorn, and the princess all saw that Diggy Dragon was telling the truth – there really were dragons living in the volcano!

Lila's mom said they would go home and come back another day. Diggy Dragon agreed and said he wanted to sleep at Lila's house that night. They all went back home, and Lila, her mom, Diggy Dragon, the unicorn, and the princess lived happily ever after. The end.
