Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived two boys named Tobin and Leven. Tobin and Leven loved going on hikes to explore. They didn't like exploring all by themselves because sometimes it was scary to be outside alone. So, Tobin and Leven usually let their parents come with them, and they would also bring their doggie, named Quinnie.

One day, Tobin and Leven went with their parents on a hike in the mountains. While hiking, their doggie, Quinnie, got distracted and went off the trail near a creek with flowing water. Tobin and Leven decided to go get Quinnie because they didn't want their doggie to drink that water. Tobin called, "Quinnie, come back here," but Quinnie wouldn't listen. So, Tobin told his mom and dad that he and Leven would go to the creek to see if Quinnie was okay, and his parents agreed to come with them.

When they all reached the creek, they saw something amazing - a magical river! The magical river was the reason Quinnie was barking. It was their first time seeing a magical river because it's not something you see every day. Magical rivers are so colorful, flowing like a rainbow. Sometimes, you can see Fruit Loops, Lucky Charms, and other yummy cereals floating through the river. The fish in this river were really silly because they were made out of gummy fish. There were also funny octopuses shaped like spiders living in the water. The magical river was truly special.

Suddenly, as they were looking at the magical river, Tobin saw something extraordinary. He pointed to the other side of the river, where there was a boat made out of Lego. Tobin asked his parents if they thought the boat would be sturdy because it was made out of Lego. His dad looked at the boat and said, "This is so sturdy." So, Tobin and his family went on the Lego boat down the magical river.

As they traveled farther down the magical river, they passed something really special - trees that grew chicken nuggets! The chicken nugget trees were quite silly because birds would pick the nuggets off the trees and fly them to the chicken nugget factory or the supermarket. One bird, named Dodo Bird, would take the chicken nuggets from the trees and deliver them to kids' homes.

Tobin thought this was a really silly place. He saw a big rubber ducky floating in the river. The rubber ducky was yellow, like a bath toy, but it was life-sized. They continued floating down the magical river until it opened up into a magic ocean. The ocean wasn't deep because it was magical. The water was shallow enough that you didn't need a boat anymore; you could just walk in it without sinking. So, Tobin and Leven went with their parents to walk around the magic ocean.

As they walked around the magic ocean, Quinnie barked again. Tobin wondered if their doggie had found something else. Leven agreed, and Tobin noticed that Leven usually didn't speak in full sentences, which made their parents laugh. When they looked at what Quinnie was barking at, they saw something huge - a dinosaur! This dinosaur didn't eat animals, people, or even vegetables. The only thing this dinosaur ate was chicken nuggets from the chicken nugget trees.

The dinosaur asked Tobin and Leven if they knew where any chicken nugget trees were. Tobin said he did, and the dinosaur offered to give them a ride if they wanted to go to the chicken nugget tree together. Tobin and Leven hopped on the dinosaur, and their parents walked beside them as they went to a special ice cream shop. This ice cream shop was unique because it sold ice cream made out of sugar from sugar chickens. It even had chicken nugget ice cream, which Tobin and Leven had never seen before.

The ice cream shop was made out of Lego, just like the boat that brought Tobin and Leven to this magical place. They decided to get the special chicken nugget ice cream that looked like a chicken nugget but was actually cold and full of ice cream. After leaving the Lego store, they went back to their Lego boat and rode off the Magic River, returning to the mountains where they started and heading back home from their hike.

After their hike, Tobin's mommy and daddy said, "Happy birthday to you two." Tobin turned five, and Tobin, Leven, and their whole family lived happily ever after. The end.
