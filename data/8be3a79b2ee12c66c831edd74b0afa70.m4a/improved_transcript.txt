Once upon a time, there was a boy who was walking down the street, and when he was walking down the street, he got a seed stuck in his leg, and it hurt a lot, but he decided to keep walking, so he walked all the way home. When he walked home, it started to rain, and it rained all over his leg. And he called his mom that he had a boo boo. And his mom said, what was it? And he said, I think I got a splinter. And his mom said, well, look at your leg. There's something green on it. And the boy said, well, what's green on it? And his mom said, look, a leaf is coming out. And he looked at his leg, and he saw a leaf was coming out. And he said, Get it out. Get it out. I don't want something to grow in me. And his mom said okay. And his mom got tweezers and took out the little thing, and she saw that it was a bean stalk, and it was something that was growing beans on it. And it was growing so quickly because of the rain. So she took it out with tweezers, and the boy asked for a bandaid. So she put on the bandaid, and then after the bandaid was on, he said, okay, it doesn't hurt anymore. Could we plant it in the ground? And his mom said okay. So then they got shovels and started to dig. While they were digging, they found some worms. So the boy put the worms in a little cardboard box called his Observatorium, and he put a little bit of dirt in there and some crumbs for the worm to eat. He had the worm in his Observatorium, and he dug in the ground with his shovel with his mom. And as he dug in the ground, he found a root. And his mom said that they should cut off the root, but the boy said he wasn't strong enough to. He said, oh, I remember we have a saw in the garage. And so he went to the garage and got the saw and cut off the root. And then he put the plant in, and then he covered it with some dirt, and it started to rain again. He went inside before the rain could get all over him. And then he went to bed. And while he was going to bed, his dad told him a story about a boy who planted a plant. And the plant grew so much that night that when he woke up, the boy was able to climb all the way to the clouds. Well, then the boy went to sleep. And the next morning when he woke up, he looked outside, and he couldn't find his plant at all, not even where it was before. So he asked his mom what could have happened. And his mom said, how about we check and dig a little bit? And they dug. And do you know what they saw? The plant was growing underground. Instead of growing uppie, the plant was growing down. So they decided to take more and more. They found its leaves and they found that the plant was making beans underground. And when they got lower and lower, they found a rabbit hole. And the rabbits were so happy because they wanted to eat the beans. So the rabbits ate some of the beans. And then the boy decided to leave it there because he wanted more to go underground for the rabbits. And from that day on, rabbits started to come right next to his house and live with him. And they would let him pet him because they ate his beans. And the boy and his mom and the rabbits. The table rafter, the end.

Once upon a time, there was a boy who was walking down the street. As he walked, he got a seed stuck in his leg, and it hurt a lot. Despite the pain, he decided to keep walking and walked all the way home. When he arrived home, it started to rain, and the rain drenched his leg. He told his mom that he had a boo-boo. His mom asked, "What is it?" He replied, "I think I got a splinter." His mom said, "Well, look at your leg. There's something green on it." The boy asked, "What's green on it?" His mom replied, "Look, a leaf is coming out." He looked at his leg and saw a leaf coming out. He exclaimed, "Get it out! Get it out! I don't want something to grow in me." His mom agreed and got tweezers to remove the little thing. She saw that it was a beanstalk, and it was growing beans on it. It was growing so quickly because of the rain. She took it out with tweezers, and the boy asked for a band-aid. She put on the band-aid, and after it was on, he said, "Okay, it doesn't hurt anymore. Could we plant it in the ground?" His mom agreed, so they got shovels and started to dig.

While they were digging, they found some worms. The boy put the worms in a little cardboard box called his Observatorium, added a bit of dirt, and some crumbs for the worms to eat. He had the worms in his Observatorium, and he dug in the ground with his shovel alongside his mom. As he dug, he found a root. His mom suggested that they should cut off the root, but the boy said he wasn't strong enough to do it. He remembered they had a saw in the garage, so he went to get it and cut off the root. He then placed the plant in the hole and covered it with dirt. It started to rain again, so he went inside before getting soaked. He went to bed, and as he was going to sleep, his dad told him a story about a boy who planted a plant that grew so much overnight that when he woke up, the boy could climb all the way to the clouds. The boy then went to sleep.

The next morning, when he woke up, he looked outside and couldn't find his plant at all, not even where it was before. He asked his mom what could have happened. His mom suggested they check and dig a little bit. As they dug, they discovered that the plant was growing underground. Instead of growing upward, the plant was growing downward. They decided to keep digging and found its leaves and that the plant was producing beans underground. As they dug deeper, they found a rabbit hole. The rabbits were delighted because they wanted to eat the beans. The rabbits ate some of the beans, and the boy decided to leave the plant there so more beans would grow underground for the rabbits. From that day on, rabbits started to come right next to his house and live with him. They allowed him to pet them because they ate his beans. The boy, his mom, and the rabbits lived happily ever after. The end.
