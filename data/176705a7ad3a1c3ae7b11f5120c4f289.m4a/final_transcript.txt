Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a boy named Boyd. Boyd lived in a magical forest filled with many different kinds of birds. There were peacocks with big, colorful feathers that looked like they had lots of eyes. Near Boyd's cottage in the forest, you could also see parrots. The parrots in this forest were really big, as big as lions! They would walk around the forest and sometimes fly above it. They were so colorful and loved to sing their parrot songs.

One day, Boyd decided he wanted to teach the parrots how to speak English because some parrots can copy what people say. So, Boyd and his mother went for a walk through the forest. On their way, they saw bluebirds, robins, and birds with yellow dots and blue feathers. Finally, they reached the king of all the birds in the forest, the mighty parrot.

The parrot was even bigger than Boyd had expected, about the size of a small car. It was so colorful and fluffy, like it was made of feathers. The parrot was very kind. When it saw Boyd coming, it told another parrot to get a present. That parrot went away through the forest and brought Boyd back a red feather.

Boyd looked at the red feather the big mighty parrot gave him. It was different from other red feathers because it had something in between the little bristles on the feather. It looked like they were tied together by a magical string. The magic string looked a bit like a spider web, but it was even tinier and made of something that glowed in the dark. If you looked closely, it seemed like a bunch of bubbles sticking together.

Boyd and his parents picked up the magic feather, and Boyd thanked the parrot. The parrot didn't know what to say because it didn't speak English. Then Boyd remembered he wanted to teach all the parrots to talk English so they could sound like regular people. Boyd had an idea. He held up the feather, the magic red feather with the glow-in-the-dark spider web kind of thing that held it together. He looked at the feather, then at the parrot, and said, "Feather." The parrot looked at Boyd and said, "Feather."

So Boyd taught the parrot its first word: feather. Then Boyd looked at the feather again and said, "Magic feather." The big, mighty parrot repeated after Boyd, saying, "Magic feather." Just like that, Boyd taught the parrot how to speak the whole English language. Soon, the big, mighty, colorful parrot could talk English.

Every day after school, Boyd would go for a walk through the forest and find the big, mighty parrot. They would have long conversations and sing songs together. The parrot was really good at singing because birds are great at making tweet songs. Now the parrot could speak and sing.

Boyd and the parrot decided to go on a tour through the city next to the forest to put on a concert for all the grownups and kids. They wanted everyone to see that there was a real animal that could talk English, and it was Boyd's magic mighty parrot.

Boyd told the parrot his idea, and the parrot was so excited. They planned to go to a fair or circus in the town and sing together. Boyd would sing a regular song, and the parrot would sing it in English. They also looked forward to treats like cotton candy at the fairs and circuses. Everyone would clap and cheer.

The mighty parrot agreed to go with Boyd to the town. The next day, Boyd, his parents, and the big, mighty parrot went to town. On the way, they saw Boyd's pet puppy. In town, there was a stadium set up for the special concert. Boyd and the parrot went on stage and started singing. Everyone gave them flowers and said it was the best concert they had ever heard.

Boyd and the parrot sang, and the whole crowd danced with them. People in the crowd danced in circles and threw flowers in the air. It was such a happy day, and it was lucky because it also happened to be Boyd's birthday. Boyd had a wonderful birthday, singing and dancing with the parrot as the crowd in the city cheered. He lived with his family happily ever after. The end.
