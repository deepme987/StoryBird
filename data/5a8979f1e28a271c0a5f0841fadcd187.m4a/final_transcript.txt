Once upon a time, there was a big boy named Alex, who was turning six years old. Alex was a prince and lived in a castle with his father, the king of the whole kingdom. The kingdom had a jungle and was near a sea, but Alex had only been in the jungle and wasn't allowed to leave the castle. He always asked his dad, "Dad, when I turn six, can I explore the jungle and see the sea?" His dad, King Henry the 95th, said, "Well, Alex, you can do it when you're six years old." So Alex was very excited.

For his 6th birthday, Alex had a pet kitty cat, and he loved all kinds of cats, big and small. His dad decided to invite all the families from Alex's school to his birthday party. There were 21 other kids in his school, making a total of 22 families. That's a lot!

His dad told Alex that they would all go to a soccer field and watch a special soccer game. Alex was very excited and thought that professional athletes would come and play. He imagined them running fast, kicking the ball far, and dribbling it all the way to the goal.

The night before his birthday, Alex went to sleep, and his dad tucked him in like a cozy burrito. The next day, he woke up early and told his parents, "It's my birthday today!" King Henry the 95th and Queen Isabella I jumped out of bed, picked him up, and said, "Yay, it's your birthday! Let's get ready to have some fun."

Alex had a Power Wheels race car that he drove through the castle and out to the big grassy field where his birthday party would be. All 22 families from his school were waiting for him in the bleachers. When Alex arrived, everyone sang "Happy Birthday" and clapped. Then, a helicopter flew in and lowered a big, yummy ice cream cake for everyone to enjoy. Alex got the first piece, and all the kids thought it was delicious.

For the special soccer game, Alex's dad announced that two tigers, Tiggy Tiger and Felix the Tiger, would play against each other. Alex was thrilled! They put a fence around the field and let the tigers out to play. The tigers dribbled the ball and ran fast, trying to score goals. It was an exciting match, but eventually, Tiggy Tiger crushed the ball with his teeth, so Felix the Tiger was declared the winner. All the kids enjoyed cotton candy and popcorn after the game.

Afterward, King Henry the 95th said it was time for Alex and his friends to explore outside the castle. They would all go on boat rides: the 21 families would ride a big sailboat, the king and queen would take a motorboat, and Alex would have his own little paddleboat.

They all went out on the ocean, and everyone on the sailboat sang and danced. Alex joined in from his paddleboat, and they all had a great time. Suddenly, the wind stopped, and the sailboat couldn't move. Alex suggested attaching a rope from the sailboat to the motorboat to tow it back to shore. They tried, but the motor wasn't strong enough.

Then, Alex had another idea: attach another rope from his paddleboat to the motorboat, so both boats could tow the sailboat. They did this, and with everyone working together, they managed to tow the sailboat back to shore. Everyone cheered and thanked Alex for saving the day. They gave him special presents, and Prince Alex, his family, and all his friends lived happily ever after. The end.
