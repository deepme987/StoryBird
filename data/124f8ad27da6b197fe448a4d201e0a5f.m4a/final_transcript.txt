Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Shauna. Shauna lived in a regular house in Richmond, Texas. One day, a monkey knocked on her door and said, "Knock, knock, knock." Shauna called her parents and asked, "Mom, Dad, can we let the monkey inside? It looks like it needs to come in." Her dad let the monkey in, and the monkey said he had important news for Shauna. He had just flown in on a monkey airplane from the jungle.

The monkey told Shauna that she had pretend monkey parents living in the jungle, and every kid in the world had pretend monkey parents too. Shauna asked if she could visit her pretend monkey parents, and her real parents asked if they could come along. Shauna agreed.

So Shauna, her parents, and the monkey went to the monkey's bumblebee car parked in their driveway. The bumblebee car had yellow and black stripes, bumblebee wings, and could fly. The monkey loved driving it because the wheels were made of pizza. As the car moved, the pizza wheels turned round and round, showing off the cheese, sauce, and yummy pizza bread.

Shauna asked if anyone ever tried to eat the car because it looked so tasty. The monkey said no, because there was a special button that squirted ketchup when the horn was honked. The bumblebee car also had cotton candy windshield wipers, which left more cotton candy on the windshield instead of cleaning it. If anyone tried to eat the cotton candy, they would get caught in a sugar trap from a pipe in the back of the car.

The monkey said they needed to cross the ocean to reach the jungle and find Shauna's pretend monkey parents. The bumblebee car turned into a submarine and went underwater. Inside the submarine, there was space for a dance party. Shauna's parents had to sit in car seats because they were visiting the pretend monkey parents. Shauna was in charge of telling them when they could leave the car seats and giving them snacks.

As the monkey drove the submarine, they found a sparkly dolphin with frog legs. The dolphin jumped from the ocean into the jungle. Shauna asked if they should follow the dolphin, but the monkey said they needed to go to a different island first. They had to race a mermaid to the island where the pretend monkey parents lived.

A mermaid appeared next to the submarine and wanted to join them. Shauna agreed, and they raced to the island. The mermaid couldn't keep up with the honey-powered submarine, so Shauna gave her a turbo booster. They reached the island at the same time.

On the island, they saw monkeys dressed as people. Shauna wondered how to find her pretend parents among all the other kids visiting the jungle island. She realized that if a kid ever wanted to find their pretend parents, they just had to wait for the bumblebee car to come to their house and take them on an ocean ride to the jungle.

In the end, Shauna decided to stay with her real parents. They took her home in the bumblebee submarine, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
