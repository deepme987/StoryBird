Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Nick. Nick lived in a house on a beach. This beach was special because it was made of sugar instead of sand. Instead of seashells, there were little pieces of candy all over it. Nick loved to bring his shovel to dig in the sugar sand and see what he could find.

One day, Nick started digging through the sugar sand with his shovel. He dug and dug until he found a rocket ship hidden beneath the beach. With his dad's help, they pulled the rocket ship out from under the sugar sand using a rope. When they got it to the surface, they saw that it was a rocket made out of playdoh. The playdoh rocket looked big enough to go to outer space, but it wasn't sturdy enough.

So Nick asked his friends to help make it stronger. His friends, including Jonah and Max, came to help. Jonah had an idea to put titanium, a very strong metal, on the outside of the playdoh to make it stronger. Together, they wrapped the playdoh rocket ship in titanium until it was ready to blast off.

On the bottom of the rocket ship, there was an upside-down birthday candle. It was the kind that made little sparks when you lit it. Nick, Jonah, Max, and their friends, along with their parents for safety, climbed into the playdoh rocket ship. One of them used a special lighter to light the birthday candle. They counted down, "Three, two, one, blast off!"

The candle started to twinkle and make sparks, but the rocket ship didn't move. One of the kids suggested they needed to count down from ten instead. So they tried again, "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, blast off!" This time, the birthday candle worked, and they blasted off to outer space.

As they soared higher, they saw the sugar beach and candy below them. Soon, they were above clouds made of cotton candy and reached outer space. In outer space, they saw a meteor made of gold, full of treasures, and shaped like a big bus. It had lots of jewels and sparkly, shiny things on it.

Nick suggested they steer the rocket ship to the meteor, so they did. When they landed on the meteor, they discovered it was a kitty cat meteor! There were cats all over the meteor, and inside, they found winged kitty cats that could fly. In space, it's easy to float, so the kitty cats floated and flew all around.

Nick told his friends they should capture one of the flying kitty cats and bring it back to Earth to show everyone. Jonah agreed, and Max gently caught a flying kitty cat and put it in the playdoh rocket ship. They started heading back to Earth.

As they traveled, some aliens flew by. The aliens looked like round balls with eyes all over them. One alien's eye came out like a tongue and looked inside the rocket ship. Nick wondered if it was an alien, and Jonah agreed it must be because of all the eyes.

The alien saw the flying kitty cat and started talking through its eye. The kitty cat responded, and they had a conversation. The alien wanted to take the flying kitty cat, but Nick had an idea. He offered the alien some sugar from the rocket ship, which came from Sugar Beach. The alien ate the sugar and decided to be nice and not take the flying kitty cat.

Nick, Jonah, Max, and their friends flew the rocket ship back to Earth with the flying kitty cat. They landed safely on a boat using a parachute. The captain of the boat was amazed by the flying kitty cat and called the president, the king, queens, princes, and everyone in the world, including TV people, athletes, and cartoon characters, to tell them about Nick's discovery.

The captain pressed a green button on the ship, which was used to tell everyone in the world important news. Nick's dad's phone started ringing, and it was Chase from Paw Patrol calling for Nick. Chase congratulated Nick on finding the flying kitty cat and asked if he would watch Paw Patrol again. Nick said, "Maybe," and his dad agreed.

That night, Nick watched Paw Patrol and kept the flying kitty cat in his house. They kept the playdoh rocket ship for future adventures, and they all lived happily ever after. The end. Don't forget to tell all your friends about this fun story!
