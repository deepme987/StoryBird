Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Devin. Devin was such a good four-year-old that she even knew how to talk to pretend fairies. When Devin talked to pretend fairies, she whispered very quietly so nobody could hear. Devin would say things like, "whispery, whispery, whispery." That's a secret code that can make a fairy come alive!

One day, Devin said "whispery, whispery, whispery," and looked behind her. Guess what she saw in the mirror? A secret door! She could walk into the mirror and go to a land where there was a fairy. So Devin opened the door in the mirror and walked inside.

When she walked inside the mirror, there was a big tunnel with lots of lights on the ceiling. Instead of having a ground, there was a little stream with water that looked like it came from a bathtub because it had some bubbles in it. Devin looked up at the lights and splashed in the little puddles as she walked.

Suddenly, she saw a picture of a chicken and a frog. The frog jumped out of the picture and into the water, and the chicken said, "cluck, cluck," as it flew out of the picture. They both started flying in the magic tunnel behind the mirror in Devin's house.

At the end of the tunnel, Devin saw a waterfall with rainbow-colored water. When she got close, the waterfall stopped, and she saw a round door with jewels and special rocks on it. It had a sign that said, "Kids only. No grownups and no adults allowed."

Devin opened the door and saw a snowy land that looked like the North Pole. But it wasn't cold! She saw lots of silly creatures, like fairies with candy cane wands instead of wings, doggies with three tails that could fly like helicopters, and pigs that lived in muddy tunnels.

A robot came to clean the pigs and put feathers on them, turning them into flying pigs! One pig found ice skates hanging from a telephone pole and started ice skating around the North Pole ice skating rink.

Devin saw the best ice skater of all, a kitty cat named Klangu. Klangu could walk on its sharp claws and ice skate on them too! The kitty cat did a silly dance on the ice while drinking milk from an upside-down cow hanging on a rope.

Devin realized she forgot to tell her mom she was going to the magic place. She said goodbye to her friends and went back through the mirror to her house. That night, as she went to sleep in her pajamas, she remembered the magic words but didn't tell anyone else. Devin and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
