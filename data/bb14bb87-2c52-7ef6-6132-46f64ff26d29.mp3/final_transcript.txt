Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a boy named Enzo. Enzo and his family loved having cereal in the morning, but they couldn't have it every day because it wasn't always the healthiest breakfast. One morning, Enzo was going to have Lucky Charms. Lucky Charms are a really yummy cereal with little rainbow marshmallows in them. When it was time for Enzo to have his Lucky Charms, his mom got a bowl and poured the cereal from the box into it. But she accidentally spilled all of the Lucky Charms all over the table, chairs, and floor. Enzo's mom said, "Oops." But Enzo said, "Look, mom. Look what just happened." And Enzo pointed to the floor, where his mom saw that the little Lucky Charms were growing tiny legs, and the marshmallow ones were rolling. All of the Lucky Charms on the floor started to walk.

The Lucky Charms walked to the front door of Enzo's house, and then they climbed on top of each other until they made a big line all the way up to the doorknob. When they reached the doorknob, they turned it and opened the door. All of the Lucky Charms went outside. It was like they were marching in a single file, all going in the same direction. The leader of the Lucky Charms was a little green leprechaun. This sneaky leprechaun had been hiding in the Lucky Charms box, and Enzo asked his parents if they could hold his hand as they followed the Lucky Charms on their march through the sidewalks of Sacramento. Enzo's parents agreed, so they all held hands and followed the line of Lucky Charms, led by the green leprechaun. The leprechaun was holding a traffic light with red, yellow, and green colors. He said, "Red light," and made his traffic light show red, so all of the Lucky Charms stopped. Then he made it show green, and they all started marching again through the grass to a trail in the forest.

Suddenly, Enzo saw that the leprechaun made a purple light appear on his traffic light. Enzo had never seen a purple light before. But when the leprechaun did it, all of the Lucky Charms knew it was dance time because green means go, red means stop, yellow means slow, and purple means dance. So the Lucky Charms all started to dance, going in circles and having a huge dance party. All of the birds nearby wanted to join the dance party, so they tried to tweet, tweet, tweet. But the birds weren't as good at making musical sounds as some of the crickets. The crickets that joined the dance party with the Lucky Charms and the leprechaun were good at playing drums. They picked up little sticks and banged them on rocks, making a nice drum sound. Enzo had a really fun time at the dance party with the Lucky Charms and the leprechaun.

Suddenly, the leprechaun saw that one of the trees was secretly a dragon in disguise. You could tell this because if you looked closely at the tree, it didn't have bark on it. It had scales like a lizard. So if you looked really closely, you could see that it wasn't a tree, but the tail of a dragon. All the Lucky Charms started to dance around the tree, and some even climbed up it during the dance party. The dragon woke up and pulled its tail out of the ground. The branches of the tree turned into a dragon head. The dragon looked at the sun and breathed in a big breath. As it breathed in while looking at the sun, some of the sun's fire went into the dragon's mouth, down its throat, and into its tummy, giving the dragon firepower. Enzo was amazed. He had no idea that when his mom poured Lucky Charms that morning, this would happen. So Enzo told his mom they should see what the dragon would do. His mom watched as the dragon flapped its wings and started to fly above the forest. Enzo pointed because he saw the dragon flying above the trees and near some of the nice birds who were tweeting for the dance party. The dragon looked scary at first because it could breathe hot fire, but it was actually a nice dragon.

Next to the tree that used to be the dragon, there was a stuffed toy, and the dragon liked to play. So Enzo decided to play with the Lucky Charms until the dragon returned. While Enzo was playing, he saw that some of the dirt was turning into sand, and some of the sand was turning into quicksand, making it really swampy. Quicksand is a type of sand that people can get stuck in, and once you're stuck, if you move, you get even more stuck. Your foot, or even your whole legs, could get trapped in quicksand. That's exactly what started to happen. All of the Lucky Charms climbed up the trees as Enzo and his parents held hands, and the ground they were standing on turned into a little bit of quicksand. Enzo said, "Help. Help." His dad put Enzo on his shoulders, and then Enzo asked, "What about mom?" So Enzo climbed off his dad's shoulders, went on his mom's shoulders, and then his mom climbed on his dad's shoulders, making a shoulder pile.

Just as Enzo was starting to worry about the quicksand, the dragon returned with some of the Lucky Charms still holding onto it. When the friendly dragon saw that Enzo and his family were stuck in the quicksand, it quickly flew down through the trees in the forest and put its big tail right where they were standing. Enzo's dad held onto the tail first, then Enzo jumped off his mom onto the dragon's tail. They all held onto the dragon's tail, and the dragon lifted them out of the quicksand. The Lucky Charms on the dragon went back on the ground, and the ground stopped being quicksand, turning back into regular dirt and rocks. The dance party started again, and Enzo was so happy to have met the friendly dragon. Enzo and his family enjoyed the dance party, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
