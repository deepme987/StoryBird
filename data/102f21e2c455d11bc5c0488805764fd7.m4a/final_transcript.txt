Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two sisters named Kennedy and Emerson. Emerson's fourth birthday was coming up, and Kennedy and their mama planned a special surprise. They decided to have a unicorn ice cream cake for Emerson's birthday. When the big day arrived, they put four candles on the cake, lit them, and sang happy birthday to Emerson. As Emerson blew out the candles, Kennedy noticed the unicorn's eyes open! The unicorn ice cream cake had come to life and looked right at Kennedy.

Kennedy excitedly told Emerson, "Look at your birthday cake! It turned real!" Emerson looked at the ice cream unicorn cake and saw its eyes open. The unicorn cake then started to walk on the table!

Kennedy and Emerson were amazed and asked their mama if she had ever seen a unicorn ice cream cake come to life and walk on a table. Their mama said she hadn't. The sisters learned that a fair was coming to town soon, and they decided to show everyone their ice cream unicorn. The ice cream unicorn told them to call her Meow Meow because she made a meow sound like a cat. Kennedy and Emerson agreed and called her Meow Meow.

Meow Meow the ice cream unicorn was getting ready for the fair and told Kennedy and Emerson that she would perform a special trick for everyone. The trick involved saying "poof," creating little fireworks around her, making butterflies appear, turning her horn into blueberries, and having wings made of carrots. She would also make flashlights bounce up and down, creating light everywhere. Kennedy and Emerson thought it was a great idea.

The next day, they went to the fair. It was a magical place with rainbow-colored tents, a big Ferris wheel, candy and cotton candy stands, hot dogs, pettable pigs, race cars, and lots of treats. Kennedy and Emerson entered the fair, and everyone started asking them about their real ice cream unicorn. They told everyone about the trick Meow Meow would perform.

The person in charge of the fair announced to everyone that Kennedy and Emerson had a special trick involving an ice cream unicorn. Everyone cheered and gathered around. Kennedy and Emerson brought Meow Meow onto the stage, and she performed her amazing trick with fireworks, butterflies, flashlights, carrot wings, and a blueberry horn. Everyone loved it!

However, Kennedy and Emerson worried that Meow Meow might melt in the warm tent. They asked the person in charge of the fair for some ice. He wore a silly hat and two pairs of glasses, one on top of the other. He brought them a bucket of ice, and they placed Meow Meow on it so she wouldn't melt. Meow Meow felt much better.

Kennedy and Emerson asked Meow Meow where she wanted to go, and she said she wanted to go back to their house. Their mama drove them all home, and that night, they decided to make their house very cold with a big air conditioner so Meow Meow wouldn't melt. They all wore coats inside to stay warm.

From then on, everyone in the house wore coats and kept the house cold to keep Meow Meow from melting. They had lots of fun playing with their friendly ice cream unicorn. One day, Meow Meow discovered a special fruit that looked like an apple but was long like a banana and tasted like a watermelon. This fruit turned Meow Meow into a fruit unicorn that wouldn't melt! They didn't have to keep the house cold anymore, and Kennedy, Emerson, and Meow Meow the fruit unicorn lived happily ever after. The end.
