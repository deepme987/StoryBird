Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Lily. Lily was really happy because there was a submarine parked in the ocean near Boston. Lily's parents told her that they were going to go on the submarine to explore. Lily had never been on a submarine before, so she was very excited.

The next day, Lily's parents put her in her car seat and they drove all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. When they got to the ocean, Lily saw a big red submarine with a picture of a birthday cake painted on it. On top of the submarine, there was a captain. Lily's parents parked the car, and they all started walking to the big red submarine with the birthday cake picture on it.

When they got to the submarine, they saw a long line of other kids waiting for a submarine ride, too. They waited their turn in line, and then they gave the captain their tickets. Lily and her parents went inside the submarine.

The captain said that they were going to go on a real submarine ride under the ocean and explore a new part of the ocean where the water was yellow and where nobody had been before. All the kids said yay. They strapped into their seats, and a person came around asking if they wanted milk or orange juice. Lily chose both orange juice and milk. She had two glasses of orange juice and just a little bit of milk.

Then the captain made an announcement, saying everyone should buckle their seatbelts because the submarine was about to depart for the secret yellow sea. All the kids started to clap. Lily saw the captain get in his seat and press a button that turned on the engine. The submarine started going fast through the ocean.

As the submarine went into the ocean, Lily saw lots of colorful fish swimming in circles. She also saw crabs, lobsters, and a whale with eyes as big as a kid's mouth. Lily kept looking at all the special things out of the submarine's window when suddenly she saw that the water was getting yellower. She told the captain, and he announced that they had reached the secret yellow water place. They were going to have the submarine go to the bottom of the ocean and watch what happens.

The captain turned off the engine, and the submarine floated there. As it floated, Lily saw several mermaids swimming through the yellow water. But an octopus was chasing them! The octopus tried to squirt chocolate pudding to capture the mermaids because mermaids aren't good at swimming through chocolate pudding. But all the octopus could really squirt out was jello. The mermaids swam between the jello as the octopus chased them.

Lily told the captain that the submarine needed to go between the octopus and the mermaids so the octopus couldn't capture them. But just as she said that, the octopus squirted out some jello and a mermaid got stuck. Lily told the captain to make the submarine go through the jello to break it up and free the mermaid.

The captain listened and turned on the engine. The submarine went through the jello, and the mermaid got unstuck. The mermaid knocked on the submarine's door and asked if she could come in. She promised not to get the submarine wet. The captain agreed, so the submarine went to the surface, and the captain opened the hatch. Lily and all the kids got to walk out on top of the submarine, which was floating like a big boat on the water.

The mermaid thanked all the kids, especially Lily, for helping her. Lily asked why the water was yellow and how the mermaids came to live there. The Mermaid Princess explained that there was an underwater volcano nearby that made yellow lava instead of red. The yellow color in the water came from the yellow lava.

Lily said she had never heard of yellow lava before. The Mermaid Princess told her that yellow lava could create shiny jewelry and gems when it cooled down. Red lava just made regular black rocks, but yellow lava made gems like red shiny ones, different colored ones, and even see-through ones like crystals and diamonds.

Lily asked the Mermaid Princess if she could have a special gem from the yellow lava at the bottom of the Yellow Sea. The mermaid agreed and dove back down into the water. She returned with a special rainbow-colored gem and gave it to Lily. All the kids clapped as Lily held the gem, feeling like she had a special power.

Lily thanked the Mermaid Princess for the gem. The kids asked Lily what her special power was. Lily said they would see once they were back in the submarine. So the captain, Lily, and all her friends went back inside. The captain closed the hatch, and the submarine went back under the Yellow Sea, heading for Boston.

On the way back, the kids asked Lily to show them the special power of the rainbow-colored gem from the yellow lava. Lily held the gem tightly in her hand, raised it high, and said, "Fish power." Suddenly, all the seals, whales, sharks, octopuses, and fish in the ocean formed a line and followed the submarine. It was the longest line of fish that had ever existed.

Lily and the captain returned to Boston, and when they got out of the submarine, the fish were still in a line. Lily told the fish to go back home, and they all swam back to their houses under the ocean.

Lily went back home with her family and lived happily ever after. The end.
