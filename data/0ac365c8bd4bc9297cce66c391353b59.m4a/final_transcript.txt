Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Elena. Elena loved to play with her rubber ducky during bath time. She also enjoyed feeding real ducks when she visited the pond. One day, Elena and her parents decided to bring their rubber ducky to a real pond. Elena and her mom walked to the pond, carrying the rubber ducky with them. When they arrived, they threw crackers and bread to the real ducks swimming in the pond. Elena and her mom tossed crackers to all the ducks, and soon many ducks came close to them, quacking happily.

Just then, Elena placed her rubber ducky on the ground, and the other ducks seemed to like it. One of the ducks quacked at Elena's rubber ducky, and suddenly, it turned into a real duck! Elena's rubber duck asked for some crackers, so she told her mom they had to give the last cracker to her rubber ducky because it had turned real. As Elena fed the ducks, she noticed a fox with big, floppy, blue ears and a long tail, like an elephant's, hiding in the grass near the pond. It looked like a fox, but its big ears made it stand out.

The fox approached the pond and told Elena that it used to be a stuffed toy, but after meeting a real fox, it had turned into a real one, keeping its blue, floppy ears. Elena told the fox it was okay and asked if it wanted some crackers. The fox declined, saying foxes don't like crackers. But Elena's mom had brought a sandwich, so Elena and the fox decided to share it. The fox asked Elena's rubber ducky, now a real duck, if they could be friends, and the duck agreed. Elena reminded them to be nice to each other, and they both promised they would.

Elena and the rubber ducky noticed a shiny crown in a tree nearby. They tried to climb the tree to get the crown, but they couldn't do it alone. The fox decided to help, letting Elena step on its back and using its floppy ears to lift her up. Elena climbed the tree, grabbed the crown, and brought it down. Her mom said she was so proud of her. The crown sparkled with diamonds, looking like it belonged to a real queen. Elena's mom told her it was the most special crown any five-year-old had ever found.

Elena explained that a princess used to live by the pond, and her mom was surprised. The fox and the rubber ducky confirmed Elena's story, saying the princess loved stuffed toys and had owned the fox toy. As the day grew late, Elena and her mom decided it was time to go home. They said goodbye to the rubber ducky, who at first wanted to stay at the pond but then changed its mind and asked to go home with them. Elena and her mom agreed, and the rubber ducky, now real, could still live in Elena's house. The fox with the floppy ears also came to live with Elena as her pet. Elena brought the crown home, and whenever her friends visited, they marveled at it. Elena and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
