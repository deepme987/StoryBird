Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cece. She lived in a magical world where houses were made of cotton candy, flowers grew all year round, smiling faces filled the clouds, and butterflies laughed and giggled just like people. In Cece's magical world, everybody was happy. There were cars shaped like bananas, and all the bugs marched and sang together. It was so much fun to live in this world!

The sidewalks had slides on them, so if a kid wanted to slide down the sidewalk, they could just press the hose button and slide away. The policemen and firemen in this world had a special job - giving stickers to kids. There were petting farms filled with unicorns of all ages: baby unicorns, regular unicorns, mama and dad unicorns, and even old grandpa unicorns. When unicorns get old, their tails turn rainbow-colored, and they love to make gifts appear from their eyes.

Cece loved going to the unicorn farm, but one day, she noticed a mistake in the sky. There was a rainbow, but it was upside down! Cece and her mom walked past the magical sheep, who dressed up in people clothes, and approached an old grandpa unicorn. They saw a baby unicorn crying, and Cece had never seen a unicorn cry before. The baby unicorn's tears turned into gems, diamonds, and pearls, which fell to the ground. The crying made the rainbow turn upside down, and the butterflies in the land started to fly in circles, looking sad.

Cece asked the grandpa unicorn what they could do, and he said they needed to solve the mystery of the baby unicorn's tears. Only someone with two hands and human ears could help, and that's when Cece knew she could be the one. The grandpa unicorn told her to pick up the baby unicorn, hold it in her arms, and sing a lullaby like "Rock-a-bye Baby." Cece was unsure if she could do it, but the old unicorn encouraged her.

Cece went to the baby unicorn and started petting it. The baby stopped crying, and the gems and jewels from its tears began turning into a treasure box. Cece knew the baby unicorn wanted her to hold it, so she picked it up and placed it in a unicorn stroller. She covered the baby with a blanket and told it what a good unicorn it was. The baby unicorn stopped crying, and the upside-down rainbow turned right side up again.

From the rainbow, colored flashlights appeared, and the butterflies flew up to their matching colors on the rainbow. The multi-colored butterflies stayed in the sky, watching glitter fireworks created by the other unicorns' colorful tails. Cece and the unicorns were so happy, and everyone in the magical world was proud of Cece for taking such good care of the baby unicorn.

Cece and her family lived happily ever after in their magical world. The end.
