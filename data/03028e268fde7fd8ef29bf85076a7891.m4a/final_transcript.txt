Once upon a time, there was a big boy named Cedar. Cedar lived in a house with a backyard and a garage. In the garage, Cedar's dad had lots of bicycles and tools for building things. Cedar decided to invite his friend Ethan over to play. Ethan came to Cedar's house, and they started playing in the backyard when suddenly they saw a snake. The snake was many colors - red, green, and blue, and it wasn't very big. But Cedar said they should be careful. Ethan said, "My dad told me that if a snake has lots of colors, we need to be extra careful because it could be a poisonous snake."

So Cedar and Ethan went back inside the house and told their mom and dad. They said, "Mom, dad, there's a poisonous snake in the backyard." The mom and dad said, "Thanks for telling us, and good job being safe by staying away." Cedar's mom and dad went to the backyard with a stick. They said, "Whenever you're near a dangerous snake, it's good to have a stick. So if it comes close, you can swat it away." Cedar and Ethan watched from the porch, and before the mom and dad reached the snake, a rabbit appeared. The snake hissed at the rabbit and spat something out of its mouth. It was poison. The rabbit collapsed and couldn't move anymore. Cedar's dad used the stick to scare the snake away, and it slithered into a hole, never to be seen again.

Cedar and Ethan said, "Quick, save the rabbit because the snake didn't eat it yet." Cedar's mom checked the rabbit and saw that it was still thumping a little bit, going thump, thump, thump, and its leg was moving. Cedar's mom said, "Quick, let's take it to the animal hospital." So Cedar, Ethan, and Cedar's mom and dad got in the car with the rabbit in the trunk. Cedar said, "Let's zoom to the hospital." They zoomed to the hospital with the rabbit.

When they arrived at the animal hospital, they saw many dogs and cats with their owners. The dogs were scared of the animal doctor, called a veterinarian. The rabbit wasn't scared because it couldn't move much. Cedar and Ethan went to the front desk and told the person in charge, "We have an emergency. A snake spat poison at the rabbit. It can't move much now, but it's still thumping and moving its leg a little. Can you save it?" The person behind the desk said, "Everyone, please wait your turn. There's an emergency with a rabbit that got poisoned by a snake, so we need to help it first."

They gave Cedar and Ethan some chocolate quarters as a reward. The boys decided to save the chocolate until they knew the rabbit was okay. The veterinarian let them watch what he did. He said, "First, we'll put the rabbit on a table and listen to its heartbeat." The doctor put an instrument on the rabbit's chest and listened closely. 

He said, "I have important news." Cedar asked, "What is it?" Ethan said, "I think I know." The doctor said, "The good news is the rabbit has a heartbeat. It's still alive." Ethan said, "I knew it because I saw its leg moving." The doctor said, "But there's bad news. I don't have anything to remove the poison. We need to figure out a solution."

Cedar remembered he had blue food coloring in his pocket, and Ethan had red food coloring. They decided to mix the colors in a shot and give it to the rabbit to see if it helped. Cedar whispered the idea to his mom, who said it was excellent. They mixed the food coloring and put it in the shot. Ethan suggested blowing on it, so he did. The doctor gave the rabbit the shot, and it worked! The rabbit got better, jumped into Ethan's lap, and then into Cedar's lap. 

Cedar's mom said Cedar could keep the rabbit as a pet in the garage. Ethan asked, "What about me?" Cedar's dad said, "You can have the rabbit on weekends." They agreed, took the rabbit home, and put it in the garage. The rabbit was happy, and the snake was never seen again. Cedar, Ethan, Cedar's mom, and dad lived happily ever after. The doctor helped the rabbit, but only because of Cedar and Ethan's idea for the shot that removed the poison. The end.
