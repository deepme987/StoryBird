Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four-year-old girl named Everly. Everly and her mom and dad were taking a walk outside their house. It was a rainy day, so Everly wore her rain boots and brought her Paw Patrol umbrella, which had pictures of Chase, Sky, and Zuma. As they walked, Everly noticed a green tunnel and said, "Mom, Dad, look. I found a secret green tunnel." Her parents saw flashing lights next to the tunnel and decided to explore it.

They went through the magical green tunnel and found a magic forest filled with trees and unusual animals. There were rabbits dressed like people, kangaroos riding bicycles, six-legged dogs, birds flying with kites instead of wings, talking ladybugs, tiny dinosaurs, and giant worms. Everly and her parents continued walking and found a magical tree with a yellow button and a red button.

Everly pressed the yellow button, causing oranges to grow on the tree and produce orange juice. She stopped pressing the button to avoid flooding the forest with orange juice. Then, she pressed the red button, and apples grew on the tree, turning into applesauce. The applesauce poured out, and Everly tried to stop pressing the button, but it got stuck.

Everly asked her parents for help, and suddenly, Chase from Paw Patrol appeared. Chase called for assistance from Rubble and Rocky, who used tools to unstick the red button. All the animals in the forest helped clean up the applesauce mess.

Everly decided it was time to go home, but they couldn't find the magical tunnel. A fairy appeared and showed them the way back. Everly and her parents went through the magic tunnel, returned home, and lived happily ever after. The end.
