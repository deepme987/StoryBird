Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named David. David was walking down the street with his mom when suddenly he heard a siren. The siren went, woo, woo, woo, woo. David's mom asked, "Is that a fire truck?" David looked and didn't see a fire truck. He said, "I think it's an ambulance." But after listening a bit more, he realized it went, woo, woo, woo, and said, "It's a police car." Just then, a police car came down the street and stopped by David and his mom.

The policeman got out of the car and said, "David, we need help from you and your mom. Can you come in the police car and help us save the day?" David asked, "What happened?" The policeman explained, "There's a frog stuck in a net in the middle of the lake, and we need a kid to help us because kids are good at catching frogs and saving them." David asked his mom if they could go, and she agreed. So they got in the back of the police car, put on their seatbelts, and went with the police car as the siren went woo, woo, woo all the way to the big lake.

When they arrived at the lake, they saw a police boat. The boat was big, with room for David, his mom, and even a kitty. David noticed the policeman's green gun and asked about it. The policeman explained it was a water gun for his police boat duties. They all got on the boat, and the policeman started the motor. As they zoomed through the lake, they saw some Ninja Turtles. These turtles were greener than regular turtles, wore bandanas, and could do ninja jumps.

The Ninja Turtles approached the police boat and said they heard there was an emergency. David told them about the frog stuck in the net, and the Ninja Turtles decided to help. One of them asked the policeman to spray his shell with the water gun, and the policeman agreed. The Ninja Turtle was happy, and they all continued toward the trapped frog.

As they got closer, they realized it was a bigger emergency. The net was huge, as big as a boat, and it wasn't a fisherman's net. It was an alligator's net! The alligator had learned how to make nets and was trapping all the frogs. They definitely needed the Ninja Turtles, the policeman, and his water gun.

The policeman zoomed the boat up to the alligator and its net. The alligator said they'd never get the net because it could make nets like a spider makes webs. David asked his mom if alligators could really do that, and she said this might be a magical alligator. The Ninja Turtles told the alligator to stop trapping the frogs, but the alligator refused.

Just then, they heard a noise in the sky. It was Batman! He flew down to the police boat and asked if David needed help from a superhero. David said yes, so Batman had an idea. He told the alligator he would give it a timeout in an alligator room if it didn't let the frogs go. The alligator challenged Batman, but Batman caught the alligator with his superhero hands and made it apologize.

The alligator explained it was trapping the frogs to make them pets. Batman told the alligator it needed to go to a pet store instead. The alligator agreed to be good from then on. The policeman let David spray the alligator with the water gun to show they weren't mad anymore.

Batman, the Ninja Turtles, David, the policeman, and David's mom all went back to shore with the saved frogs. The frogs were happy, the alligator became good, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
