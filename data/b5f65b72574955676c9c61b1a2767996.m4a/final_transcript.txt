Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Twiggy. Twiggy's mom told her that they were going to go for a pony ride through the snow that day. So, Twiggy's mom put her in a car seat, and they drove very carefully through the snowstorm. When they reached the horse and pony stables, Twiggy got out of the car, and her mom put some gloves on her because it was cold. Twiggy looked at the ponies and thought they looked nice. The person in charge of the pony rides said, "Twiggy, it's your turn to go on the pony." She picked up Twiggy and put her on the pony. Twiggy was so happy because she was going for a pony ride through the snow.

Twiggy had an idea. She asked the person in charge of the ponies to put a shovel in front of the pony. This way, while she was riding the pony, it could also shovel the snow in front of it. The lady in charge agreed, and the pony started to shovel snow while Twiggy went for a ride. They decided to go through a snowy forest.

This snowy forest had beautiful white trees covered in snow, and it was full of white squirrels, white bunny rabbits, and white foxes. It even had a kingdom of octopuses. These octopuses dressed up like people and were cowboy octopuses. They liked to ride horses and ponies and used ropes as lassos to catch different animals.

Twiggy and the pony approached an octopus wearing a straw hat, boots on each of its eight tentacles, glasses, and holding a long piece of dental floss and a toothbrush. The octopus said, "Twiggy, my mama said I have to brush my teeth today, but I just wanted to go on a pony ride with you." Twiggy told the octopus to brush its teeth first. The octopus agreed and started brushing its teeth with a bit of snow on its toothbrush.

Soon, the octopus's mama came and said, "Baby octopus, you're not supposed to brush your teeth with snow. You should use kids toothpaste." The baby octopus was sad because it wanted to brush its teeth with snow. So, the mama octopus said, "Today, you can brush your teeth with ketchup." The baby octopus was happy because Twiggy's mom had ketchup in her backpack. Twiggy's mom put some ketchup on the octopus's toothbrush, and it brushed its teeth with ketchup, making a big mess.

Twiggy's mom said, "Octopus, you're so dirty now. How can you go for a pony ride with so much ketchup on you?" The octopus said it knew how to clean up. Twiggy asked how, and the octopus said, "Just watch." It pulled a string attached to a white tree, and a bucket of water fell from a high branch, washing some of the ketchup off its face.

Twiggy told the octopus it could go on the pony ride now that it was clean. But the octopus's mama said it needed to be wrapped up warmly in a towel first because octopuses get cold after a bath. The mama wrapped the octopus in a towel and helped it onto the pony with Twiggy. They were ready for a fun snow pony ride.

The octopus held onto Twiggy as they rode the pony through the snowy forest. They saw white birds and a white fox wearing socks but no shoes. The octopus said the fox's socks would get wet, and its feet would feel cold. Twiggy asked the fox if its feet were cold, and it said yes. So, Twiggy invited the fox to join their pony ride.

As they continued, they saw a sad squirrel with no boots, socks, or gloves. Its hands and feet were cold from having a snowball fight with other squirrels. The squirrel asked if it could join the pony ride, and Twiggy agreed. Twiggy's mom helped the white squirrel onto the pony with Twiggy, the octopus, and the fox. The pony was getting crowded, so the lady in charge said it was time to go back to the stable. On the way back, Twiggy saw a rainbow and thought she saw a treasure box at the end of it. She asked the fox, squirrel, and octopus to get the treasure box for her after the ride.

Twiggy got off the pony at the stable, and the animals said goodbye. She went home in her car seat and back to her house. The next day, the squirrel, octopus, and fox knocked on her door with the treasure box. Twiggy opened it and found a birthday cake, necklaces, bracelets, a princess dress, and toys inside. Twiggy and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
