Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Mika. Mika lived in a house in Harbor City, California. One day, as she opened her front door, she saw a bluebird carrying a letter. The letter had a string attached to it, and the bluebird held onto the string with its birdie feet. When the bluebird reached Mika's house, it dropped the letter into her hand.

Mika took the letter and the string inside her house. She noticed an "M" on the letter, which was for her since her name was Mika. She asked her parents for scissors to open the envelope and see what was inside. Mika's mom got some scissors, and they opened the letter together. Inside, there was a furry white ticket that said "Ticket to the North Pole."

Mika showed her mom the white furry ticket, and her mom said, "Woohoo, now we get to go to the North Pole!" Mika and her parents packed their suitcases, and the next day they went to the shore. There, they saw a big boat made of ice waiting for them. The boat even had big sails made of ice, perfect for a trip to the North Pole.

The ice boat also had a strong motor, which used a race car motor to make it go. The boat was so strong that it even had airplane wings, so if there was a big piece of ice it couldn't go through, it could just fly over it. Mika saw some penguins living on the ice boat. The captain of the ice boat came out and asked if anyone had a furry white ticket. Mika showed her ticket, and the captain said, "Okay, all aboard!"

Mika and her family boarded the ice ship. The captain honked the horn, pulled up the deck, and off they went, sailing away from California, heading north past Alaska on their way to the North Pole.

Two days later, Mika and her family were getting really close to the North Pole. Mika could see that it was snowing a lot outside, and there were big pieces of ice floating in the ocean. She also saw a giant whale next to their boat. This whale looked like a special North Pole whale. It was as big as a regular whale, but it had fur to keep it warm. The whale also had a big horn where its nose should have been. This whale was called a narwhal.

The narwhal came up to the ice boat and said, "Welcome to the North Pole!" Mika was surprised to hear a talking whale. The narwhal explained that only people and narwhals could talk English. Most people didn't know narwhals could talk because they lived in the North Pole, and there weren't many videos of them talking on phones.

The narwhal told Mika that its horn was a magic wand. It could make anything happen, but it needed to know the magic words. Mika asked the narwhal what kind of magic it could do. The narwhal asked Mika what her favorite thing to put on noodles was, and she said tomato sauce. The narwhal said some magic words, and the whole ocean turned into tomato sauce!

All the ice floated in the tomato sauce ocean, and the polar bears enjoyed eating the sauce. Mika's ice boat floated in the tomato sauce too. The narwhal asked Mika if there was anything else she wanted. Mika asked if the narwhal could turn the ice in the North Pole into gems or rubies. The narwhal said yes and said the magic words "Avra Kedavra." Suddenly, all the ice turned into giant, shining rubies.

The rubies floated in the tomato sauce ocean, and the penguins walked around the ruby icebergs, sipping the tomato sauce. Fish jumped out of the ocean, and the polar bears didn't want to eat them anymore because they just wanted tomato sauce. So the fish and polar bears became friends, and everyone in the North Pole lived happily ever after. The end.
