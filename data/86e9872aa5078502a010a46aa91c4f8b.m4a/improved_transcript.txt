Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a wallaby named Jesse. A wallaby is like a small kangaroo, about 2ft tall. Jesse the wallaby loved to ski with his mom Amanda, his brother Jonah, and his dad Steve, who were all wallabies. Jesse the ski wallaby went with his family to go skiing at Cadrona, a ski resort. They rented skis for Jesse, who had special big ski boots for his big wallaby feet. Jesse put on his skis and got ready to go on the ski lift with his family.

They skied over to the bottom of the ski lift and got in line. On the ski lift, Jesse could see all the ski bunnies and ski wallabies skiing around that day. Some of them were going fast, doing races, jumps, and flips, while others were going slow and just learning. They reached the top of the mountain, and as they were getting ready to go down the slope, Jesse noticed that one of his gloves was missing. He had dropped it without realizing while he was on the ski lift.

Jesse's brother Jonah looked at the map and saw that the ski lift went over a difficult slope called Captain. Jesse's mom asked if he was brave enough to go down Captain's and look for his glove. Jesse, although a little scared, decided to be brave and search for his special rainbow-colored, sparkly glove. They skied down Captains, but they couldn't find the glove anywhere. Jesse was sad but tried to remain brave.

When they got to the bottom, Jesse's mom decided to treat them all to some hot carrot juice at the lodge. Inside the lodge, Jesse saw a wallaby wearing a bright green ski vest, purple gloves, and his missing sparkly rainbow glove on its ear. Jesse approached the wallaby, who kindly returned the glove, thanking Jesse for keeping his ear warm and cozy. With his glove back, Jesse continued to enjoy his skiing adventure with his family. The end.
