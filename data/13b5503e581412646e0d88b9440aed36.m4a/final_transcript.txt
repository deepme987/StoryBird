Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Sharia. Sharia lived in a nice little house made of playdoh. It wasn't a small playdoh house like kids could make; it was a big house with walls made of playdoh. To keep the roof strong during rain, storms, or windy days, Sharia and her family covered the playdoh roof with Lego. The Lego pieces were connected so tightly that you could build a whole real house with them. So, the outside of Sharia's house was made of Lego, and the inside was made of playdoh.

Many people loved visiting Sharia's house because, after knocking on the door and saying the secret password, "kitty cat meow meow," they could enter her playdoh house. Inside, there was a dark room with a low light switch for kids to use. When they flipped the switch, fireflies appeared instead of a light bulb. The fireflies flying together in the dark room made it very bright, revealing the secret room.

To enter the secret room in Sharia's house, you had to find a cabinet with a door, open it, and then find some licorice inside. By pulling the licorice, the cabinet turned into a secret tunnel leading to Sharia's magical kitchen.

The magical kitchen was a place where kids could cook recipes and decide what they wanted to make all by themselves. It was safe because the oven and stove worked by magic. Everything in the kitchen was made of playdoh, except for the golden microwave.

The golden microwave didn't use electricity, but when you put something in it, like a drawing of a cookie, a real cookie would come out. This special microwave was a favorite among kids, so Sharia had to decide how many kids were allowed into her house with its Lego exterior, playdoh interior, firefly entrance, secret cabinet with licorice, and magical kitchen with the golden microwave.

One day, Sharia decided to try making things other than food. She drew a rainbow, put it in the microwave, and pressed the button. When they opened the door, a real little rainbow appeared. Sharia's friends got excited because they could pick up and move the small rainbow. They took turns holding it and trying to put their fingers through it.

Next, Sharia drew a rose and put it in the golden microwave. At first, nothing happened, but then it started to shake and make noise. When Sharia opened the door, there was a real rose inside. She and her friends decided to make flowers to give to people who were sick, having a hard day, or just not feeling well. They handed out flowers to everyone who passed by their Lego and playdoh house.

Sharia then had another idea. She thought about drawing Anna from Frozen and seeing if the golden microwave could bring her to life. Sharia and her friends carefully drew Anna, fixing any mistakes they made. When they finished, Sharia put the drawing in the golden microwave and pressed the button.

As the microwave worked, the fireflies from the entrance room flew through the secret cabinet tunnel to the kitchen. They circled above the golden microwave while it beeped. When Sharia opened the door, Anna from Frozen appeared. She told Sharia and her friends that she could play with them and have a fun time. Sharia and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
