Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Margot. Margot was walking around her house when she saw the most beautiful caterpillar she had ever seen on a gray rock. The caterpillar was rainbow-colored and had little dots on it that looked like stars and shone like fireflies. Margot picked up the caterpillar and brought it to her house.

When she got inside, Margot's mom said that it was a very rare rainbow caterpillar, usually found in rainforests. Nobody knew how it got to Seattle. Margot and her parents decided to make a special caterpillar house for it using popsicle sticks, tinfoil, dirt, and grass. Margot, who was good at arts and crafts, added pipe cleaners and tunnels made from straws for the caterpillar to explore.

Margot was so happy to have the caterpillar. Her mom bought her a costume with caterpillar wings that she could wear on her arms and pretend to be a butterfly. Margot loved her new wings and started to flap them near the caterpillar's house. She decided to feed the caterpillar some rainbow sprinkles left over from an ice cream treat. The caterpillar began to eat the sprinkles and started to grow wings.

As the caterpillar grew wings, Margot's costume wings started to become real. The caterpillar turned into a beautiful rainbow butterfly, and Margot could really fly with her new wings. Something magical must have happened when the caterpillar used its firefly power and the rainbow sprinkles.

Margot took off the roof of the caterpillar house, and the butterfly flew around her house, leaving a trail of magical dust that turned everything it touched to gold. Margot followed the rainbow butterfly outside and flew through the sky with it.

The rainbow butterfly and Margot flew to Mercer Island, near Seattle, where they met Foola the Fairy in a park. Foola lived in a house made of graham crackers and had a throne made of special thorns that didn't hurt. Foola asked Margot and the butterfly how they got their magical powers. The butterfly explained its journey from the Amazon rainforest to Seattle, and how it helped Margot become a real butterfly too.

Foola the Fairy saw the magical dust from Margot's wings and asked if they could fly together and do tricks. Margot agreed and showed Foola her gymnastics skills in the air. Foola told Margot she was the only person to ever grow real wings.

Margot asked Foola how she could remove her wings and become a regular girl again. Foola said there was a magical octopus living in a cloud who knew the secret. They had to say the magic words "kuba kaba, kuba kaba" to the octopus. Margot, Foola, and the rainbow butterfly flew to the cloud and met the giant octopus.

Margot tried to say the magic words, but the octopus said she needed to say "sh" loudly. Margot said "sh," and the octopus showed her a secret button under her nose on her upper lip. If she touched that spot three times while saying "sh," her wings would disappear, and she could become a regular girl again. Other girls could also get wings by doing the same thing.

Margot flew back home with the rainbow butterfly and turned back into a regular girl by pressing the secret button. She could still make her wings appear whenever she wanted. Margot and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
