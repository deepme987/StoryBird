Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four and a half-year-old girl named Emilyn. She lived with her family in a house high up in the snowy mountains. The roof of their house was white and covered in snow, and the trees around the house were also full of snow, with no leaves on their branches. There was so much snow on the ground near Emilyn's house.

One day, Emilyn was walking right outside her house when she saw many kitty cats playing in the snow. One of the kitty cats was pulling a little kitty-sized sled with a baby kitten in it, while its mama cat led the way. The kitty cats asked Emilyn if she wanted them to pull her on a magic sled. Emilyn said, "Okay!" So, she climbed onto the magic sled, which was yellow and blue.

Many kitty cats worked together to pull Emilyn on her magic sled through the white, white snow. As they traveled, they saw trees that could walk! These trees had eyes and mouths, and they wore little hats on top of their branches. Each tree was full of snow and walked around wearing many different colorful hats. There were also snowmen in the forest who could roll around and weren't stuck in one place. Some of them looked like they were really alive, moving around and climbing up trees. The snowmen would bounce up and down, and some could jump as high as a tree!

Soon enough, they met some dogs. The dogs started barking at the kitty cats, which made them a little scared. But Emilyn told the kitty cats that they could go on the magic sled to be safe. As the dogs came closer, Emilyn told them they had to behave. She looked in the sled, and it magically made some dog toys appear! So, Emilyn took out some soft dog toys and gave them to the dogs, making them very happy.

The dogs wanted to be friends with the kitty cats and offered to help pull the magic sled since they were stronger. The kitty cats could also go for a sled ride. The kitty cats said, "Yay!" Emilyn joined the kitty cats on the magic sled, and the dogs held their toys in their mouths while also pulling the sled rope through the snow.

They traveled through the snow for a long time until they came across a magical igloo. An igloo is a house made of ice with a round top and is a little bit underground. Emilyn went up to the igloo, and one of the dogs barked at the door. Emilyn said, "Don't bark at the door, dog, because I am going to knock on it." She got off her magic sled, and all the kitty cats and dogs followed her. Emilyn knocked on the igloo door, and it opened by itself.

Inside the igloo, they discovered a secret toy factory! There were big machines making all sorts of stuffed animals and other toys like dolls, race cars, and trains. There was even a machine that turned rubber bands into big trampolines! Emilyn asked the owner of the factory if she and her animal friends could look around, and the owner said yes.

As they explored the toy factory, they saw monkeys working the machines! It was strange because Emilyn didn't know that monkeys could work in factories. But there they were, pressing buttons, turning switches, and even using a laptop computer. One monkey was talking on the phone, and another was holding a stuffed animal while walking a dog.

Emilyn asked the factory owner why the monkeys acted like people. The owner explained that in secret igloo factories, usually found in the North Pole and South Pole where it's very snowy, there are smart monkeys that can do things people can do. Emilyn looked at the monkeys, and they did look like regular people because they had human-like eyes, and some even wore glasses.

Emilyn was having a great time in the factory, but she noticed it was getting late. She told the kitty cats and dogs to start marching single file out of the toy factory. The floor was slippery because it was made of ice, and the dogs started to slip and slide. The owner of the toy factory warned them not to bump into the machines. Emilyn told the dogs to be careful, and with the help of the kitty cats, they regained their balance and continued marching up the stairs and out of the igloo toy factory.

When they got outside, Emilyn saw that all the kitty cats were very happy because the factory owner had given them kitty toys. The dogs were also really happy because they got dog treats. Emilyn was thrilled because she received four different stuffed animals. She thanked the owner and promised to come back to the secret igloo toy factory another day.

Emilyn rode the magic sled all the way back to her house with her new animal friends. She went home that evening and lived happily ever after. The end.
