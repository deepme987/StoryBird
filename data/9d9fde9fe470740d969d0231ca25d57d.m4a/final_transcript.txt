Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a five-year-old boy named Inksha. Inksha lived in a big apartment building and had a special bedroom. Sometimes, Inksha would go with his mom or dad down the elevator, outside of his building, and all the way to the playground. Inksha loved going to the playground because there were swings, slides, climbing structures, and sometimes even a sandbox.

One day, when Inksha went to the playground, he saw that it was not the regular playground. Instead, everything had turned into chocolate! The swings, slides, and climbing structures were all chocolate. Even the sandbox was different – it was filled with pink sugar! The poles that you could slide down, like firemen poles, were made of candy canes.

Inksha asked his parents how everything could be made of chocolate and candy. His parents said they didn't know, and it was a big mystery. Inksha looked around and spotted something unusual. Far away, across the street and behind a tree, there was something that looked like a piece of paper. But it wasn't regular paper or construction paper. It was paper chocolate!

The paper chocolate could dance around and walk on its paper chocolate legs. It had paper chocolate arms and a paper chocolate head with paper chocolate eyes, a paper chocolate nose, and a smiley paper chocolate mouth.

Inksha told his parents about the paper chocolate, but they couldn't see it because it was hiding behind the tree. So, Inksha and his parents crossed the street safely, holding hands, to see where the paper chocolate went. They found it still by the tree, but the paper chocolate used its arms and legs to climb up the tree so Inksha wouldn't catch it.

Inksha showed his mom and dad that the paper chocolate was on a branch in the tree. He asked his dad to get it down for him. His dad agreed to try but needed a little help. Inksha's dad asked if he could put one of his feet on Inksha's hands for a boost. Inksha wasn't sure if he was strong enough, but his mom encouraged him to try. Inksha tried, and he was strong enough! He gave his dad a boost up the tree, and his dad got the paper chocolate.

Inksha, his mom, and his dad asked the paper chocolate why it made the playground chocolate. The paper chocolate explained that there was a monster, and a mighty monkey was trying to scare it away by playing on the playground. The mighty monkey asked for help from the paper chocolate because it needed to use the chocolate playground equipment to keep the monster away. The monster was actually a nice monster that didn't like chocolate but loved vegetables.

Inksha and his parents decided that the paper chocolate was being nice. They told the paper chocolate it could go, and Inksha's dad put it down. The paper chocolate asked Inksha if he wanted to be friends, and Inksha said yes. The paper chocolate held Inksha's hand, and they both went home together, up the elevator in Inksha's building, all the way to Inksha's apartment.

The paper chocolate would do a trick where every time one of Inksha's friends came over, it would create a new piece of chocolate. Inksha and the paper chocolate gave little chocolates to all of Inksha's friends whenever they visited. Inksha, his family, and the paper chocolate lived happily ever after. The end.
