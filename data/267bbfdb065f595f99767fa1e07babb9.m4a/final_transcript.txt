Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. They were going on an adventure to a museum that was hidden underground. To enter the museum, they had to go through a secret tunnel. The door to the museum was made of a giant rock, and the doorknob was a sparkling gem. Instead of touching the doorknob, they had to say a secret password, which changed every day. Jonah and Jesse went through the tunnel and reached the big rock door with the gem doorknob. They tried to figure out what the secret password was. Jesse said, "kitty cat meow meow," but the door didn't open. Jonah guessed that it might be "rock gem open," but the door didn't open either.

While they were trying to figure out the password, Jonah and Jesse realized they couldn't just guess it, so they decided to look for clues. Jesse spotted some letters written backward on the ground in the dirt near the rock door. Jonah read the letters, and they said, "Secret Museum." As soon as Jonah read the letters, the gem doorknob started to glow, and the rock door made a rumbling sound. Then it sank into the ground.

Instead of opening like a normal door, the door disappeared into the ground. Jonah and Jesse looked inside the museum and saw a guard dressed in a pink suit, wearing a pink hat and orange gloves. The guard welcomed them to the oldest museum in the world and offered to give them a tour. The museum was filled with secrets and magical items, added by one person from each generation, chosen because they were the closest to a magician.

Jonah and Jesse agreed to the tour and started walking down a hallway with a blue carpet that felt squishy, like chocolate pudding or yogurt. As they walked, their footsteps left prints on the ceiling. The guard showed them the first exhibit: the first car ever made, which had an engine made out of Lego. Jonah and Jesse were surprised because Lego hadn't been invented yet, but the guard explained that the inventor of the car had been very advanced for his time.

The guard demonstrated the car's abilities by turning the glass in front of the car into sand, and the car drove out. The car drove over the squishy carpet, vacuuming it up and transforming it into a drone. The guard let Jonah and Jesse ride in the car, but first, they had to wear pink jackets. When they put on the jackets, they felt like they had dinosaur strength but still had regular people bodies.

Jonah and Jesse zoomed through the museum on their drone car, seeing many different inventions, like the first light bulb, which had a candle inside. Eventually, they wanted to test their dino strength, so they asked to leave the museum. The guard warned them that they would lose their dino strength if they left, but they decided to go anyway.

As soon as they left the museum, the rock wall with the gem went back up, and they lost their dino strength. It was getting late, so Jonah and Jesse had to go back home. They knew they would return to the museum another time because there were so many different parts they hadn't seen yet. Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda lived happily ever after. The end.
