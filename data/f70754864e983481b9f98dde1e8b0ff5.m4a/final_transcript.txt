Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a princess named Kaya. Kaya lived in a faraway land, in a magical castle. This castle was special because it had big fountains in front of it. But instead of water, the fountains had chocolate! Kaya had a little baby sister named Reya, and they were the princesses of the special chocolate castle.

One day, Kaya was walking through the garden when she smelled something very interesting and funny. She asked her mom, the queen, "What is that smell?" Her mom replied, "That's rosemary." Kaya found the rosemary bushes and thought they smelled very interesting. The next day, while cooking dinner, Kaya asked her mom if she could smell some rosemary in the kitchen, and her mom showed her a spice jar.

That night, Kaya had a special dream. In the dream, she and her sister opened their bedroom window and climbed down a ladder safely with a grown-up watching. When they reached the bottom of the castle, they found a sandbox under one of the chocolate fountains. In the sandbox lived many interesting creatures, including Jumpy the Grasshopper. Jumpy was the king of all grasshoppers, and that's why he lived in the palace with Kaya and Reya.

Jumpy the Grasshopper was not an ordinary grasshopper. He was a pet grasshopper, and he was as big as a horse! Jumpy wore special clothing and had a leash. Kaya and Reya could ride on Jumpy, but they had to wear seatbelts. Jumpy would then take them on exciting jumping adventures.

One day, Kaya and Reya asked their mom if they could go on an adventure with Jumpy. Their mom said yes, so they strapped themselves onto Jumpy. They pressed the red adventure button on Jumpy, and he hopped so far that he landed on a cloud!

Kaya and Reya had never been so high up before. They asked Jumpy if it was safe, and he said it was because he had a special spider web that attached him to the clouds. Jumpy hopped from cloud to cloud with the princesses.

On one of the clouds, they found a big water bottle. This was Kaya's secret, special magic water bottle that she used when she was really thirsty. Inside the water bottle lived a tiny fish in a special pink liquid. The fish was Kaya's secret pet, and only Reya knew about it.

They found the water bottle on the cloud, and Kaya told Jumpy that if he drank some of the special juice, it would give him extra jumping powers. Jumpy agreed and took a sip. Suddenly, he got turbo rocket engine boosters on his legs! He asked Kaya and Reya if they wanted to go on an even bigger adventure, and they said yes. So, Jumpy hopped all the way to the Moon!

On the Moon, Kaya, Reya, and Jumpy saw a rope that connected the Moon to the Earth. This rope kept the Moon from floating away. They decided to take the rope back down to Earth instead of jumping. When they reached the bottom, they found themselves in a huge playground.

This playground was a city called Grasshoppaville, where only grasshoppers lived. These grasshoppers were regular-sized, not as big as Jumpy. They were so happy to see their king, Jumpy the Grasshopper. Kaya shared some of her special magic drink with the little grasshoppers. Then, she told Jumpy it was time to go back to the castle. Jumpy jumped all the way back to the castle, where Kaya and Reya lived happily ever after. The end.
