Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two twins named Saxton and Jackson. One morning, while they were still in bed, they heard some noise outside their house. Curious, Saxton and Jackson looked out the window and saw some construction. They went to their mom and dad and said, "Mom, Dad, look, there's construction outside." Their parents replied, "Okay, let's go look." They went to their front door, opened it, and saw dump trucks, bulldozers, and many people with shovels, helmets, and yellow vests.

Saxton and Jackson's dad asked one of the workers, "Why are you doing construction here?" The construction worker explained that they were building a new underground zoo near Saxton and Jackson's house. The twins couldn't believe it and thought it was a joke. But the construction worker assured their dad that it was true and that the zoo was almost ready. Saxton found it hard to believe, and Jackson asked, "How can the zoo be almost ready if you just started construction?" The worker explained that they had been digging underground for a long time, which was why they sometimes heard strange noises in their house.

The construction worker asked Saxton and Jackson if they wanted to visit the secret zoo under their house. Excited, the twins agreed. The worker took them outside and gave them yellow construction hats to wear. They saw a big pole, like a fireman's pole, that led underground. They held onto the pole and went down. When they reached the underground zoo, they saw many small animals. There was a giraffe as tall as a kitty cat and an elephant the size of a dog. Saxton and Jackson exclaimed, "We've never seen such big animals look so small!" The construction worker explained that they had given the animals magic cereal, which made them small.

The worker asked Saxton and Jackson if they wanted to take the little elephant and giraffe outside. Saxton agreed and wanted to ride the elephant, while Jackson wanted to walk the giraffe on a leash. They found an elevator and went back up to the ground. Jackson found a long string to use as a leash, and Saxton helped hold it too. They walked around the block with the little elephant and giraffe, and everyone was amazed by the tiny animals.

Saxton and Jackson proudly told everyone about the underground zoo and that there might be secret zoos under other houses too. Just then, a bird flew up to Jackson and asked if they knew how to get to the underground zoo. Jackson told the bird they had just been there, and the bird explained that it was friends with the elephant and giraffe and knew how to make them big again. Saxton asked how, and the bird said it needed a gummy worm. The sugar in the gummy worm would make the animals grow.

Jackson asked where to find gummy worms, and the bird said it had a secret stash of candy in its nest. It flew up, grabbed some gummy worms, and gave one to the giraffe and one to the elephant. The animals turned rainbow-colored and started to grow. Saxton was riding the elephant, and as it grew, he was as high as a tree. Jackson climbed the giraffe, and he could see even higher than the tallest tree.

Saxton and Jackson's parents told them to come down, worried they might fall. The twins carefully climbed down, and many people came to see the giant animals. The bird returned and said they needed to make the animals small again. Saxton and Jackson asked how, and the bird said it needed a lollipop.

The bird brought back lollipops for the giraffe and elephant. As they licked the lollipops, they turned into friendly dragons that could breathe fire for roasting marshmallows. Saxton and Jackson rode the dragons, offering marshmallow treats to other kids. The dragons carefully roasted marshmallows for everyone.

Saxton and Jackson were happy with their marshmallow treats, but their mom warned them not to eat too many. They asked the bird to turn the animals back into a giraffe and elephant by giving them chocolate. The bird fetched chocolate from its nest and gave it to the animals, who turned back into a small giraffe and elephant. They returned to the underground zoo, and Saxton and Jackson went back home, living happily ever after. The end.
