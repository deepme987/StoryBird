Why are you calling it? Tonight's makeup story is a song for my two year old son, Jesse. Jesse, what do you want to be in the makeup song? A green ball. And what else? What else do you want in it, bud? A car. Okay. One time, a long, long time ago, there was a toddler who loved to play with Power Wheels. And the Toddler would drive up and down his driveway. One day, a birdie came and the birdie said to the Toddler, that is my Power Wheels. But the toddler said, It's not the birdie's turn. So the birdie found some balloons and the birdie gave the balloons to The Toddler. And then the Toddler got out of his Power Wheels and he decided to find a yummy chocolate chip cookie. So he picked up the chocolate chip cookie and he ate it all up. And then the Toddler told his mama that he wanted to slide down a slide. So he got his monster truck and he pushed it down a slide. And then the Toddler went down the slide. And on the bottom, there was a green squishy ball. Yeah, that one. And the Toddler said, that my green squishy ball. And inside the squishy ball, there were some rainbow sprinkles. And when The Toddler squeezed the squishy ball, some ice cream came out of the squishy ball. And the Toddler ate the ice cream all up. And then he saw the trampoline and he started to jump up and down. And the Toddler said, we who. And while we because The Toddler was having fun jumping up and down. And then the Toddler decided that he would find some lucky charms. So he looked in a cereal box and he found some yummy Lucky Charms. He asked his mama if he could have them. And his mama said yes. So the Toddler ate the Lucky Charms. And then he got so tired. So The Toddler put away his Power Wheels and he moved the slide to the side and he parked his monster truck and he saved a piece of his cookie. And then The Toddler decided to go to sleep. The end.
