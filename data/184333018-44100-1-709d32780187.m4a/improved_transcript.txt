1. For the extraction task:
- The start delimiter is 'Once upon a time' and the end delimiter is 'the end'.
- Extract the content between the delimiters, both inclusive.

The text does not contain the start delimiter 'Once upon a time'. Therefore, I cannot extract the content between the delimiters as requested.

2. For correction task:
- Use the text extracted above
- Correct the grammar and punctuations

Since there is no extracted text, I cannot proceed with the correction task. Please provide a text with the specified start and end delimiters.
