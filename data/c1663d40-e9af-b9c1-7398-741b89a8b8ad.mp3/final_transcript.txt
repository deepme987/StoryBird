Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a prince named Jesse. Jesse's dad was the king, and Jesse's mom was the queen, and Jesse lived in a castle. He had all the toys he could ever want. He had Lego, magnetiles, monster trucks, Hot Wheels, blocks, board games, and even army people. Jesse always got to play, but there was a rule: no other kids were allowed in the castle. Jesse's dad and mom were too busy ruling the kingdom to play with him, so Jesse played all by himself.

Jesse's brother, Jonah, was a teenager and was going off to college in a different country. So Jesse was all alone in his giant toy room. One day, he was racing Hot Wheels cars with both hands, wishing he had someone to play with. Suddenly, a friendly ghost appeared and asked if he could play with Jesse. Jesse said he wasn't scared of ghosts, so they started racing Hot Wheels together, and Jesse won.

The ghost told Jesse that at nighttime, he turned into a regular person. Jesse didn't believe him, but after dinner, when it got dark, the ghost disappeared. The next morning, there was an extra bowl of cereal at the table. Jesse's parents asked about it, but Jesse didn't know why it was there. After breakfast, Jesse went to the toy room, and the ghost was waiting for him.

The ghost wanted to go down the secret slide in the castle to a playground outside. Jesse said he wasn't allowed to leave the castle, but the ghost convinced him to go just for a little while. They slid down the slide into a ball pit, and the ghost turned into a boy who looked just like Jesse. They argued about who was copying whom, and Jesse decided to go back to the castle.

Before Jesse could get to the front door, the ghost-boy pushed him into the ball pit and ran inside. The king and queen welcomed him, thinking he was Jesse. The real Jesse ran to the door and tried to tell his mom the truth, but she didn't believe him. She brought both boys together and tried to figure out who was the real Jesse.

Jesse remembered a special memory about baking cookies with his mom, which the ghost-boy didn't know. That's how Jesse proved he was the real Jesse. The queen asked if Jesse would be friends with the ghost-boy, and Jesse agreed, as long as he stopped copying him. The ghost-boy agreed and turned back into a ghost.

Jesse and the ghost decided to play with blocks and build a tower in the toy room. Some blocks were too big, but the ghost had a magic saw that could cut them in half. Jesse and the ghost became friends and lived happily ever after in the castle. The end.
