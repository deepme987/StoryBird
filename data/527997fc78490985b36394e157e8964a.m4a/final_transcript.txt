Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a girl named Elena. Under Elena's bed in her room, there was a secret tunnel. Sometimes, Elena would go into the secret tunnel under her bed and climb down the secret stairs after opening the secret hatch. When Elena reached the part with a nightlight, she would turn it on by pressing a button. After turning on the nightlight, Elena saw a big slide in the secret tunnel under her bed.

One night, Elena decided to slide all the way to the bottom of the slide. When she reached the other side, she found herself in a completely different house. But this house was also above ground, which was strange because Elena's house was above ground too. How could the slide go from under Elena's bed, under the ground, and then still be on top of another house? Well, Elena got off the slide and decided to explore the other house to see if there were any windows. If there were no windows, then it was definitely underground.

Elena looked around and found a step stool. She stepped on it and went to the kitchen window. Standing on her tippy toes on the stepstool, Elena saw that there was a window and it was light outside. The house wasn't underground because she could see the sky, the grass, and even some cows that lived nearby. So, Elena decided to walk around this secret, silly house at the end of the slide under her bed. She opened the front door of the house and saw many bubbles floating in the air. On the ground, there was a big bubble machine with four different tubes that danced around and played fun music as the bubbles floated out.

Elena decided to dance in the middle of the bubbles as they floated all around her. She noticed the cows were coming closer. One of the cows approached Elena and seemed like it wanted her to go for a ride. So, Elena pet the cow and asked if it was okay for her to ride on it. Elena said, "Moo, is it okay if I go on a ride, Moo?" The cow replied, "Moo." Elena climbed onto the cow for a ride.

The cow took Elena through the grassy area, and she saw a snowy forest in the distance. The cow told Elena that in this magical place, there was a snowy forest with magical moose. Elena said she had seen regular moose before in Canada, but never a magical one. The cow suggested they go for a ride to meet the magical moose. So, Elena and the cow went past the grass, away from the house, and towards the snow.

Elena and the cow went through the snow, and luckily, Elena remembered to bring a blanket and gloves. Soon, they saw some moose. These moose were big animals with large horns, but instead of regular horns, their horns looked like branches with grapes growing out of the ends. The magical moose with grape-growing antlers approached Elena and asked how she found this magical land. Elena and the cow told the moose the whole story of how she found the secret tunnel under her bed, slid down the slide, turned on the nightlight, and ended up in the magical house.

The magical moose was happy for Elena's visit and offered her and the cow each a magic grape. They thanked the moose and decided to ride back to the magical house. Elena and the cow held their magic grapes as they stomped through the snow and returned to the grass near the magical house. When they reached the house, Elena asked the cow if she should eat the magic grape. To her surprise, the cow told Elena to show it to her mommy first.

Elena had an idea. She decided to climb up the slide that led to the magical house and then go back to her bed. Elena was good at climbing slides because she practiced all the time. Her trick was to put her toes against the slide while holding on with her fingers. So, Elena climbed up the slide, opened the secret latch, and climbed back into her bed. She went to sleep, and the next morning, she found the magic grape under her pillow.

Elena showed the magic grape to her mom, who asked what it was. Elena told her mom the whole story of the secret tunnel, the slide, the magical land, and the moose who gave her the magic grape. Her mom didn't think it was a magic grape, but Elena insisted it was. Her mom said she could eat it, so Elena got ready to eat the grape. She changed her mind and decided to put the magic grape on a spoon and bite it while holding the spoon.

Elena put the magic grape on a spoon, held it with one hand, and brought it to her mouth. She chomped on the magic grape, and nothing happened at first. But then, suddenly, Elena felt like she needed to sneeze. She said, "Ha-choo!" and as she sneezed, a unicorn appeared. The unicorn could fly through the air, and from then on, Elena had a magical pet unicorn. Elena and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
