Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical link that held a wonderful story. But, oh no! The link was broken, and the story was lost. The people of the land were very sad, for they loved the story so much.

One day, a kind and helpful proof-reader came to the land. The people asked the proof-reader, "Can you please help us find our lost story? We miss it so much!"

The proof-reader replied, "Of course! I would be happy to help. But I need you to give me the story directly, so I can read it and make it perfect for all the children in the land."

The people were so grateful and promised to bring the story to the proof-reader as soon as they could. They knew that the proof-reader would make the story even better, with the right words and punctuation, just perfect for kids aged 3 to 10 years old.

As they waited, the proof-reader reminded them, "Please remember, I will keep the story the same length as it was before. That is very important!"

The people nodded and thanked the proof-reader once again. They knew that soon, their beloved story would be back, and all the children in the land would be able to enjoy it once more. And so, the adventure to find the lost story began, with the help of the kind and talented proof-reader.
