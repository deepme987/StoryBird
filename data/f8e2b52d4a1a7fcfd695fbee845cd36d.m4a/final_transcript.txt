Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two sisters named Adley and Carlia. Adley and Carlia lived in a very snowy place, and sometimes they used their sled to go out in the snow. Sometimes their mom pulled the sled, and sometimes their dad did. They also tried skiing sometimes. It was hard for some of them, but we won't say who.

Adley and Carlia loved sledding because they would go on top of the snow and slide all the way down, shouting "wee!" After playing in the snow for a long time, their mom would give them hot cocoa, a yummy drink that you can also put milk in.

One day, Adley and Carlia were getting ready for a special sled ride when they saw a snow leopard outside. A snow leopard is a white, fluffy-tailed leopard that lives in snowy mountains. It was Adley's first time seeing one, so she asked Carlia what it was. Carlia thought it was a big cat, but she wasn't sure. Their mom told them it was a snow leopard.

The snow leopard looked like it was hunting. It darted on top of some rocks, slid down some snow, and chased a sheep on the mountain. The sheep ran away, but the snow leopard was so fast that it jumped in the air and pounced on the sheep. Instead of eating the sheep, the snow leopard hugged it and said, "Tag, you're it!" Adley and Carlia realized the snow leopard and the sheep were playing tag.

In tag, you run from each other, and one friend can say "you're it" when they touch another friend. Sometimes there are bases where the other person can't get you. The sheep went to a base, which was an igloo, a house made of snow and ice. Inside the igloo was a trumpet. The sheep blew the trumpet, and suddenly, a lot of cheetahs came running from the other side of the mountain to help.

The cheetahs said it was their turn to try to catch the snow leopard. The snow leopard tried to run up the mountain, but cheetahs are the fastest animals. The cheetahs caught the snow leopard, hugged it, and told the snow leopard it was its turn to try to catch them. The snow leopard tried, but the cheetahs were too fast.

As they played in the snow, a snowstorm began, and there was lightning and thunder. Adley and Carlia told their mom that maybe they shouldn't go sledding right now. It started to snow heavily, and their mom pulled them in the sled back to their house. Adley and Carlia worried about the animals outside, so they invited them into their house.

All the animals marched in a single-file line to Adley and Carlia's house. Their dad told the animals to behave. The snow leopard wanted to run around and have fun, but Carlia said they couldn't make a big mess in the house. Adley had an idea: they would take the animals to the basement, where there was a secret chamber leading to an ice cream factory.

The animals marched to the basement, and Adley and Carlia showed them the secret door, which looked like a refrigerator door. Inside was a big, cold, underground icy cave. In the cave was a tiger named Tiggy. Tiggy was a silly, friendly tiger who guarded the secret ice cream factory so no grownups knew about it. Adley and Carlia sometimes brought special food like pasta and noodles for Tiggy.

All the animals were happy to tour the underground ice cream factory. Inside, there was a big metal machine with a mixer that made ice cream from milk and sugar. Tiggy pressed buttons to make different flavors of ice cream for the animals to enjoy.

Suddenly, Adley and Carlia's mom came downstairs and knocked on the refrigerator door, asking what they were doing. Adley said "nothing," and Carlia said it was a secret. Their mom came in, and Tiggy told her she needed a ticket. She said she didn't need one because it was her house. Tiggy let her in, and she was proud of Adley and Carlia for having the ice cream factory.

They decided to make a special ice cream machine that could shoot ice cream into the sky in different colors, creating ice cream rainbows. This way, animals on the other side of the mountain could enjoy the ice cream too. That night, the animals left because the snowstorm was over, but they remained friends with Adley, Carlia, and Tiggy. Adley and Carlia lived happily ever after. That's the end of the story.
