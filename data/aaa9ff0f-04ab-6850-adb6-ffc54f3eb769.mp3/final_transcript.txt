Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Cheyenne. Cheyenne lived in a tall building. On every floor, including Cheyenne's, there were stairs and an elevator. It seemed like a normal building. Nobody knew that Cheyenne's building had secret compartments. Cheyenne didn't know about the secrets until one day, all the power went out. There was a blackout, and nothing worked. It was so dark.

Cheyenne told her mom she would get a flashlight, and she did. Her mom also lit some candles. Soon, it was a little easier to see, but all the lights in their apartment were still off. Cheyenne's mom said they should go downstairs. When they opened their door, they saw red emergency lights in the hallway. The elevator was closed, and the door to the stairs was jammed shut. It was hard to see.

Suddenly, Cheyenne pointed her flashlight at the ceiling and saw a hole with a rope coming down. Cheyenne asked her mom if they should climb the rope. Her mom agreed, thinking there might be a way outside. Cheyenne climbed first, followed by her mom. At the top, they found a secret floor in their building.

This secret floor had working lights. There were disco lights and floor lights that lit up when you stepped on them. If you touched the wall, it would light up too. Cheyenne told her mom that at least there was electricity on this floor. Her mom agreed but said they should still leave the building.

Just then, Cheyenne saw a little yellow creature with silly eyes running around. She pointed it out to her mom, but her mom didn't see it. Cheyenne then found a secret slide that went all the way to the bottom of the building. At the bottom, there was a bounce house, so you didn't get hurt when you landed.

Cheyenne and her mom went down the slide together. At the bottom, the bounce house was dark, but Cheyenne used her flashlight to see. They left the building through a secret exit. Outside, they saw that all the buildings had no power, and people were coming out.

Cheyenne looked at the sky and saw that the sun had turned black. The sky was trying to glow in the dark. Cheyenne told her mom something strange was happening, and her mom agreed.

Suddenly, Cheyenne saw the yellow creature from the secret floor. It reminded her of a character from a movie. The creature looked at Cheyenne, and little lightning bolts came from its eyes. Cheyenne told her mom that the creature might have secret powers. Her mom agreed that it was special.

As they watched the creature, the sky became more glow-in-the-dark, the buildings were still dark, and the sun was black. There was a strange rainbow with no colors. People were sad because the lights didn't work, the sun was black, the sky wasn't bright, and the rainbow had no colors.

Cheyenne thought the yellow creature could save the day. She gave it a lollipop from her pocket. As it ate the lollipop, the lightning in its eyes grew stronger. It shot lightning at the sun, and the sun turned yellow again. Then it shot colorful lightning at the rainbow, giving it colors.

The creature tried to look at the buildings, but it became sad. Cheyenne asked if it couldn't turn the electricity back on. The creature said "Ekabu," which Cheyenne didn't understand. Just then, her dog appeared and said it had found the secret exit too. The yellow creature rode on the dog, and it cheered up.

The creature shot a lightning bolt at the power lines, and the electricity came back on. Cheyenne told her mom that the creature saved the day. Her dog told the creature it could go now, and the creature hugged the dog.

Cheyenne, her mom, and her dog went back into the building. In the lobby, they pressed the elevator button, and it worked. They went back to their floor, but the secret hole in the ceiling was gone. They went back into their apartment, always wondering how to find the secret exit again. Cheyenne and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
