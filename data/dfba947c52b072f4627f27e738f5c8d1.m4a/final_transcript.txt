Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Scarlett. Scarlett was sitting in the living room with her mom, who was reading a book. Suddenly, Scarlett heard a loud noise on the roof. "Mom, what was that noise on the roof?" she asked. Scarlett's brother, Edward, suggested they go outside to check. So Scarlett, Edward, and their mom went outside. Their mom grabbed a broom to try to get something down from the roof, but it was too high up. Scarlett and Edward told their mom she needed a ladder to climb up to the top of the roof. Their mom got a ladder and started climbing.

When she reached the top of the roof, Scarlett's mom found some trampoline shoes. They must have fallen out of an airplane and landed on the roof, still bouncing. Trampoline shoes are so bouncy that even kids can jump as high as grown-ups. With a good pair of trampoline shoes, kids can jump as high as a tree - not the tallest tree, but a small tree or even a medium-sized tree. Trampoline shoes are really fun!

Scarlett's mom took the trampoline shoes down from the roof and said, "Scarlett and Edward, you guys are lucky because a plane dropped these trampoline shoes on our house." Scarlett and Edward put on their trampoline shoes and found they were super bouncy. Scarlett went first, jumping all the way onto the roof. Then she jumped from the roof down to the grass, while Edward also jumped as high as a small tree. They were so bouncy that everyone from their town came to watch Scarlett and Edward's jumpy bouncy show with their trampoline shoes.

As Scarlett jumped high, she saw something in the distance that looked like a big sandpit. Scarlett and Edward started jumping towards it, and their mom had to drive a car to keep up with them. They jumped all the way past the river and near the sandpit. When they arrived, a sign said, "You need a ticket to get in." Scarlett asked Edward if he had a ticket, but he didn't. They told the big friendly spider in charge of the sandpit that they didn't have any tickets. The spider said they could go in anyway. So Scarlett and Edward took off their trampoline shoes, left them at the side of the sandpit, and went in.

Inside the sandpit, Scarlett discovered that if she dug a little, she would find a robot. So Scarlett and Edward dug just a bit in the sand and found a sand robot. Sand robots are special robots that build sandcastles for kids. It was Scarlett's first time seeing a sand robot. To tell a sand robot how to build a castle, you say, "Robot sandcastle builder, do what I say," and the robot will ask, "What do you say?" Scarlett and Edward told the robot to build a tall castle with lots of windows, doors, and a special parking garage for flying cars. The robot agreed and used its secret bulldozer and magical bucket to build the best sandcastle ever.

Scarlett asked the robot if it could make a real flying car go into the sandcastle it built. The robot said they would have to go to a different place because flying cars don't live in sandpits. Scarlett and Edward agreed, put on their trampoline shoes again, and started jumping up and down. As they jumped, Scarlett saw a big swing.

Swings are really fun with trampoline shoes because you can make the swing go super fast. Scarlett told Edward they should go to the big swing, and they started jumping through the forest, over trees, and past birds until they reached the magical swing. The magical swing hung from a big palm tree on one side and a coconut tree on the other. The coconut tree could also grow grapes, apples, or even hot dogs if you found the secret button under the bark. The swing was made of a special spider web that wasn't sticky and felt like a rubber band.

On the swing, there was a big rabbit with a purple ear eating strawberries. The rabbit asked, "Scarlett, Edward, what are you doing here?" They explained they were bouncing around with their trampoline shoes and saw the fun swing in the distance. The rabbit with the purple ear said they could have a turn. Edward and Scarlett took turns on the magical swing, swinging so high they could reach airplane heights. It wasn't even scary because they had trampoline shoes, so if they fell, they would just bounce and not get hurt. Scarlett and Edward were so happy.

But as it started to get dark, they realized their mom was driving, trying to catch up to them. Scarlett and Edward used their trampoline shoes to bounce all the way home, saying goodbye to the rabbit with the purple ear, the sandpit, the nice robot that builds sandcastles, and the friendly spider.

When they got home, their mom was thrilled to hear about their adventures. Scarlett and Edward lived happily ever after. The end.
