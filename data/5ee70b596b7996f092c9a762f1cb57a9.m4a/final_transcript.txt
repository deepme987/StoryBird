Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a six-year-old boy named Beau. Beau and his little sister Amelia had some dinosaur stuffed toys. One night, while they were sleeping, Beau and Amelia saw their dinosaur toys come to life. The dinosaur toys started to walk around their room, waking up Beau and Amelia. They said, "Come outside with us." Beau and Amelia went outside to their backyard, following their dinosaur toy.

The dinosaur toy told Beau that he had a kite. The dinosaur toy started to fly the kite by holding onto a string. The wind, during the nighttime, blew the kite up. Beau held onto the string too, and he and his dinosaur toy were doing a great job flying the kite. The kite was getting higher and higher, and Beau could see that if he didn't pull it back down, it would go all the way up to the moon.

So Beau told the dinosaur toy, "Pull the kite back down," and the dinosaur said it was a special kind of kite with a really long string. It was like, imagine if you take dental floss and pull it all the way out and then attach it to another dental floss, and it just keeps going. That's what the dinosaur toy had. It had such a long string, the kite could go all the way to the moon. But Beau didn't want the kite to go all the way to the moon, because if it went all the way to the moon, then how would he get it back? He could just pull the string down.

The dinosaur told Beau it's okay if the kite goes to the moon because they could just pull the string back down. Beau said, "Okay." So they started to fly the special kite all the way up to the moon. When it got onto the moon, it got stuck on a rock. The dinosaur toy told Beau they needed to climb up the string to get to the moon to get the kite unstuck. Beau said it wasn't safe for a kid to do that. The dinosaur agreed, saying he would do it instead.

The dinosaur started to climb all the way up the string, all the way to the moon, and got the kite, which was stuck on a rock in a moon crater. The dinosaur shouted down to Beau from so far away on the moon, "Beau, the kite's ready. Can you pull it down?" The dinosaur went for a ride on the kite as Beau started flying the kite back to his house. It was a little bit heavy.

After the kite got back to Beau's house, he saw that it was turning to morning time. When it was morning, all of the dinosaur toy's friends kept coming, and they were knocking on Beau's door, and they were coming in the windows. Beau and Amelia's house was getting full of dinosaur toys, and the dinosaur toys said, "We want to play musical chairs. We want to play musical chairs." Beau and Amelia said okay.

Beau and Amelia started to arrange a lot of chairs in a big circle, and they told the dinosaur toys that when the music goes, then they could walk around, but if the music stops, they have to sit in that seat. They started to play some songs, and the dinosaurs were having so much fun playing musical chairs. They took away a chair, and one of the dinosaurs sat on Beau's lap. Another dinosaur was so silly because he sat right on top of Amelia's head, and that dinosaur toy was like, "I am a crown." But really, he wasn't a crown, really. He was just a dinosaur toy.

Then they took away another chair. Beau told the dinosaurs that he didn't want to make such a big mess in his house. One of the dinosaur toys said that he had a really good idea. Beau said, "What is it?" The dinosaur toy said, "Popcorn." Beau said, "Really? Dinosaur popcorn?" Amelia said, "I've never heard of dinosaur popcorn before." The toy dinosaur said, "No, silly goose, we're not going to make dinosaur popcorn. The way you make popcorn is you put some corn seeds in a microwave, and then you turn the microwave on, and it goes pop, pop, pop, and turns into popcorn. So the important thing is you need seeds to make popcorn."

The toy told Beau and Amelia that he had chocolate seeds. The toy asked Beau and Amelia's mom if he could use the microwave. Beau and Amelia's mom said okay. The toy put some chocolate seeds in the microwave, and Beau and Amelia's mom pressed the buttons on the microwave, and the microwave turned on. Do you know what happened? The chocolate seeds turned into chocolate popcorn.

The dinosaur said, "Yay! We made chocolate popcorn!" A different toy dinosaur said, "I also know how to make flowers in a microwave." Beau said, "How?" That toy dinosaur brought in some flower seeds and said, "All you have to do to make a flower is you put the flower seeds in the microwave, and then you turn the microwave on, and then it could turn into a popcorn flower. And then after it's a popcorn flower, you could plant the flower in the ground. As the flower gets bigger and bigger, more and more popcorn will grow."

Amelia had a good idea. Amelia said, "It's time for us to plant some of the chocolate popcorn in the ground." The toys went outside with Beau and Amelia, and they dug a big hole, and they put so many chocolate popcorn seeds in the ground. Beau and Amelia went inside, and they told their mom they needed to turn on the bath to get some water. Beau's mom said, "Why do you need some water?" Beau and Amelia said, "We need it to water the chocolate popcorn plant." So their mom said, "Okay."

They got a little bucket from the bathtub and filled it up with water and brought it outside and poured it right in the hole where the chocolate popcorn seeds were. Do you know what happened? It started to grow and grow and grow, and more and more chocolate popcorn came out. As more and more chocolate popcorn came out, all of the kids who lived in Dublin, Ireland, started to come over to Beau and Amelia's house, and everyone started to ask for chocolate popcorn.

Beau and Amelia said, "Okay, there's enough for everyone. We are so good at sharing, so we will give everyone some popcorn." All of the kids waited for turns, and Beau and Amelia were really good at sharing. But there was a problem. The chocolate popcorn plant was growing so high, it was growing all the way up to the moon.

The toy dinosaur said, "I have an idea." The idea that he had was to use the kite again. He said, "We're going to fly the kite to the moon, and when it gets to the moon, it's going to get the popcorn flower to stop growing because it'll put it on top of the popcorn flower, and then the popcorn will come back to Earth, and we could have as much popcorn as we want."

So that's what the toy dinosaurs started to do. They flew the kite all the way to the moon. They blocked the top of the popcorn chocolate plant, and then all of the popcorn started to fall down, and it made a big mountain of popcorn right in the middle of Dublin, Ireland. All of the people in the whole of Ireland started to eat some of that yummy mountain made of chocolate popcorn. Different kids had to come from all over the world to come and help, but there was still too much.

To this very day, there's a secret part of Dublin, Ireland, behind a store called Grocers that has a tunnel into the mountain. Beau and Amelia were very excited to learn more about that. So they told their toy dinosaurs that they have to go to a pretend zoo in their room, and then they would go to that mountain of popcorn a different day. The toy dinosaurs went back to Beau because it was getting to be late again, and they needed to go to sleep.

The toy dinosaurs went back into Beau and Amelia's room, and Beau and Amelia said good night, and they went to sleep and lived happily ever after. The end.
