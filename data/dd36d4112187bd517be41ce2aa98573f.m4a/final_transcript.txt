Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Ty. One morning, Ty got out of bed and went to wake up his mom. "Mom, wake up," he said. Ty's mom got up and Ty asked her, "Mom, can you give me some special cereal?" So, Ty's mom got him a bowl, some milk, and a special cereal called Lucky Tom.

The cereal box was shiny and had a pipe going through it. The box said it was made in a cereal factory. Ty's mom poured the special cereal into the bowl of milk, and Ty saw colorful sprinkles falling in too. When Ty stirred the cereal, he discovered it was made of dinosaur eggs!

Now, chicken eggs need warmth to hatch, but dinosaur eggs are different. Long ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, their eggs would hatch when placed in milk. That's why dinosaur moms put their eggs in milk.

Ty was lucky because his special cereal was full of dinosaur eggs, and they hatched in the milk! He stirred the colorful eggs with his spoon and asked his mom, "Can I really eat this? It looks like real tiny dinosaur eggs!" Ty's mom said, "Let's see what happens."

Ty scooped up some blue, green, and yellow eggs with his spoon. Just as he brought it to his mouth, the eggs hatched! Three little dinosaurs appeared on Ty's spoon: the tiniest Tyrannosaurus rex with teeth as small as sand, a little pterodactyl that could fly, and a small brachiosaur with a strong head.

The dinosaurs asked Ty, "Are you our mama?" Ty laughed and said, "No, I'm not a dinosaur. I'm a person. Silly dinosaurs." The dinosaurs asked Ty's mom if she was their mama, but she said no.

The dinosaurs asked Ty if they could climb out of the spoon and do a silly dance on the table. Ty agreed, and the three tiny dinosaurs climbed out. More eggs hatched in the bowl, and all the baby dinosaurs marched out, forming a line. They climbed down the table leg and went to the secret cabinet where Ty's mom kept candy. Ty tried to stop them, but they got there first and started munching on candy.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Ty opened it and saw a good witch. She said, "I think I left some special cereal at your house last night." Ty invited her in, and she saw the tiny dinosaurs eating candy and doing silly dances. Some were even pretending to sleep in Ty's bed and his parents' bed.

The first three dinosaurs started a bath and played in the water. The good witch told Ty she needed to take the dinosaurs back to a secret part of Antarctica where dinosaurs still lived. Ty told his mom he wanted more cereal, so she offered him Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Rice Krispies, and oatmeal. Ty and his parents lived happily ever after. The end.
