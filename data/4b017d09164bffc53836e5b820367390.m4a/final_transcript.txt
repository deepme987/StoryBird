Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Phoebe. One day, Phoebe was sitting in class, listening to her teacher, Dr. Doherty, talk about history. He wore black glasses, and it was hard for Phoebe to concentrate because there was a new girl in her school named Elisa. Elisa sat right in front of Phoebe and kept passing her blue notes. Phoebe opened one of the notes, and it said, "Meet me at the lockers right after class." Phoebe couldn't wait for the bell to ring, and all she could think about were her teacher's glasses.

When the bell finally rang, Phoebe and Elisa were the first ones to leave the classroom. The hallway was packed with students, and Phoebe noticed that everyone had blue papers. She heard some girls whispering and asked Elisa if she knew what they were talking about. Elisa said she didn't know. They reached Phoebe's locker, and when she opened it, a pile of blue notes spilled out. All of them had her name on them, and everyone was staring at her. Was this a prank? Phoebe felt small, like a bird without wings, and didn't know what to say.

Elisa took Phoebe aside and told her there was a secret, but it wasn't a bad one. The secret was that some kids were going to a water park after school, and they wanted Phoebe to come too. The more blue notes you had, the more people wanted you to join them. Phoebe wasn't sure if she could go because her parents were always busy, but Elisa thought it was important to tell her friend.

After school, Phoebe asked her mom if they could go to the water park for a little while. Her mom agreed, and they went to the water park together. When they arrived, Phoebe didn't see any of her friends and felt alone, like a small wave in a big ocean. She asked her mom if they could go home, but her mom suggested waiting a bit longer. Just then, Elisa appeared and shouted, "Surprise! It's a surprise party for you, Phoebe!"

All of Phoebe's friends were there, and some even dressed up in costumes. One friend gave Phoebe a flower and said it symbolized their friendship and its future. Phoebe thanked her and asked what they should do at the water park. Elisa said there would be a magic show, and they all decided to watch it.

The magician was very good, and his tricks were hard to figure out. The coolest trick was when he made the water slide turn into ice. Phoebe and Elisa couldn't understand how he did it, so they asked him after the show. The magician reached into his pocket and pulled out two blue notes with their names on them. Phoebe and Elisa were amazed because they didn't know how the magician knew about the blue notes from school.

It turned out that Phoebe's friends were there to help her, and the big secret was the surprise party. Phoebe had a great time and asked her mom if they could stay longer. Her mom agreed, and Phoebe and her friends, including Elisa, had a fantastic day. They all lived happily ever after. The end.
