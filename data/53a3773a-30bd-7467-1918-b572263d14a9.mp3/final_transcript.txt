Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a doll named Jesse. Jesse lived in a dollhouse with his doll brother, Jonah, and their doll parents. Their cozy dollhouse had beds just for dolls and even a pretend kitchen with pretend furniture. Jesse and Jonah shared a bed, while their parents slept in another.

The dollhouse could open up, and if Jesse or Jonah wanted to jump off the top, they could land on the shelf it was on. Sometimes, when no one was looking, Jesse and Jonah would sneak out of the dollhouse and play on the shelf. The shelf was made of blocks, which could be slippery because of some slime that would get on them. Dolls don't have very grippy feet, so Jesse and Jonah would sometimes slip and slide on the slime until they fell onto a big green carpet below.

On the green carpet, Jesse and Jonah could see all the different toys in the house. The other toys couldn't come alive like them, but Jesse and Jonah wished that one of the toys would come to life and play with them. Jesse had an idea! He told Jonah they should find a treasure box toy and a dragon toy, put the dragon in the treasure box, and bring it back to their dollhouse. They would also need a little bit of the Silly Putty from the bookshelf. Jesse believed that mixing everything together would turn the toy dragon into a real dragon.

So, Jesse and Jonah found a toy dragon and a treasure box, and carefully climbed up the slippery bookshelf. They grabbed some slime and brought everything back to their dollhouse. In the pretend kitchen, they mixed the dragon, treasure box, slime, and some pretend water from the pretend sink. Jesse blew on the mixture, and suddenly, the dragon came to life!

The dragon asked Jesse if it was a doll too. Jonah explained that it used to be a toy, but Jesse's magic turned it into a real dragon. The dragon asked if Jesse was its dad, but Jesse said he wasn't. The dragon then promised to do whatever Jesse asked. So, Jesse asked for a ride, and he and Jonah climbed onto the dragon's back.

The dragon gave Jesse and Jonah a magical ride through the room, past the slime-covered blocks, and over the green carpet. Jesse and Jonah told the dragon to fly outside and explore the real world. The dragon obeyed and flew out the front door. Outside, they discovered a magnificent magnet tile kingdom filled with bees and butterflies.

Jesse and Jonah rode the dragon to the top of the magnet tile kingdom, curious to see if there was a real ceiling in the sky. The dragon flew higher and higher until they got close to the colorful magnet tiles. Jesse climbed onto Jonah's shoulders to touch the sky, which was indeed made of an orange magnet tile. On the other side, Jesse saw a light but couldn't tell if it was the sun or a flashlight.

As Jesse carefully climbed back onto the dragon, he slipped, but the dragon caught him just in time. Safely back on the dragon, Jesse and Jonah noticed other dollhouses and real houses in a village nearby. They decided to visit them another day, as it was getting late and the light above the magnet tiles was dimming.

Jesse told the dragon to fly back home, and they soared past the buzzing bees and through the front door. Back in their dollhouse, Jesse and Jonah excitedly told their doll parents about their adventure. And so, Jesse, Jonah, and their parents lived happily ever after. The end.
