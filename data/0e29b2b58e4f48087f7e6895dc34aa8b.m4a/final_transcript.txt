Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a boy named Jude. Jude went to school, and there was always one kid who was a bit of a bully. The bully wouldn't let Jude play on the playground, saying, "It's my playground. You can't go here." Jude wished the bully would learn to share.

One day, during recess, it started to rain, and soon there was thunder. Jude saw a big flash of lightning, which was a little scary. All the kids, including the bully, ran inside. They were all wet from the rain, so they went back to their desks since recess was over.

Jude looked out the window and saw a ninja with a lightning bolt on its chest. He told his classmates, "Look out the window!" Everyone saw the ninja, and the teacher let them go to the window for a closer look. The ninja ran up to the window and tapped on it.

Jude asked his teacher if he could open the window, and the teacher agreed. When the window opened, the ninja slipped inside, even though the window was only open a tiny bit. The ninja ran around the room, doing amazing flips. The teacher said, "Catch that ninja!" The kids tried to catch the ninja, but they couldn't.

Jude suggested they split up to catch the ninja, but they still couldn't catch him. The ninja was just too fast and agile. Then, the school alarm bell went off. The kids thought it was a fire drill, so they left the classroom and went outside in the rain, chanting, "Ninja alert! Ninja alert!"

Outside, Jude saw a red lightning bolt strike the bully, turning him into a ninja. Jude was worried the bully would be a bad ninja, so he hid behind a teacher. But the good ninja, the one from the window, stood in front of Jude and promised to protect him. The bully challenged the good ninja.

Instead of fighting, they decided to play rock, paper, scissors. The good ninja won, and the bad ninja got angry. The good ninja took out a secret weapon from his pocket: a tiny pet dragon. The dragon breathed ketchup onto the bully, taking away his ninja powers and turning him back into a regular kid.

The bully felt bad and explained that he just wanted people to play with him. Jude and the good ninja told him that being nice was a better way to make friends. The bully promised to be nice from then on.

The good ninja gave the former bully a plastic ninja sword to play pretend sword games with other kids. The bully was happy that Jude and the ninja had helped him become a better person. He asked Jude to be friends, and Jude agreed, but also said he would need some space sometimes. The former bully understood, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
