Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a princess named Ryan. She lived in an old castle made of stone, with big parts that looked like upside-down ice cream cones. The tops of the castle were made of real ice cream cones, but they also had bricks and stones on the outside to make them strong. Everyone in the kingdom called it the Cupcake Ice Cream Cone Castle, and it was very special.

One day, Princess Ryan's father, the king, told her, "Princess Ryan, tomorrow is your birthday!" Princess Ryan was excited and said, "Yay, it's going to be my birthday!" She went to find her sister Jamie, and together they went outside the castle to have breakfast. When they opened the big castle doors, they saw a picnic set up for them. For breakfast, they were going to have chocolate chip muffins, which made them very happy because they usually didn't get to eat those for breakfast.

"Is it because tomorrow is Ryan's birthday?" Yes, it was! When Ryan asked her parents why she got to have a muffin for breakfast, her mom, the queen, told her it was because her birthday was the next day.

As Ryan was eating her muffin, she saw a horse with no leash or saddle, just walking around by itself. The horse was big and white, with a big star on its chest between its front legs. Princess Ryan loved to call this horse Starry. Starry was her favorite horse because sometimes when she was eating breakfast outside, Starry would offer her a ride. Her parents would let her go, and she would climb up on Starry and go for a gentle ride. Starry was very careful with kids and didn't go too fast unless they wanted to, but when they were ready, Starry was great at jumping.

One day, as Princess Ryan was riding Starry, a squirrel ran across the grass. Starry jumped over the squirrel and got out of the way, and Princess Ryan held on the whole time. After she finished riding Starry, she went back to breakfast, where her sister Jamie was crying. Ryan asked Jamie why she was crying, and Jamie said there was no soap left, so they couldn't make any bubble baths or clean themselves. They couldn't even wash their hands!

Ryan told her sister Jamie that they could go on a hunt to find out who took all the soap. They got on their horses, and their mom and dad followed. They looked around the little village near their castle for the missing soap. Starry was really on the lookout. As Ryan was riding Starry, the horse neighed, and Ryan noticed something sneaky on the other side of the water. There was a big pile of bubble bath! So many cans, bottles, and jugs of bubble bath were piled on top of each other on the other side of the river.

Ryan didn't know how to get across the river because whoever took the soap must have made bubble bath with it, and they needed to get the bubble bath back. She knew there was no way a person could cross the river, but luckily, Starry the horse neighed again and carefully crossed the river. Starry didn't slip on any rocks and didn't let the current push him down. Once they reached the bubble bath, Starry made a special sound that only kids could hear.

After Starry made that sound, lots of different horses came from all directions. They were all sorts of colors and sizes, with different tails and ears. Some even looked like they were wearing shoes! All the horses came to the rescue and helped carry the bubble bath. Each horse picked up a bottle of bubble bath in its mouth and carried it across the river to the castle. They saved the day because the soap had turned into bubble bath, and now they had so much of it! But Princess Ryan and Jamie didn't know what made the soap turn into bubble bath, so they decided they had to solve that mystery.

As they were going to sleep that night, they wondered how to figure out how the soap turned into bubble bath. Just then, a special cow appeared outside the castle and said, "Moo." It was carrying a box. Princess Ryan and Jamie opened the castle door, took the box from the cow, and carried it up the stairs. They opened the box and found a little bubble bath-making machine! You put soap on one side, water on the other, and a fan in the middle mixed it up, turning soap into bubble bath.

Princesses Ryan and Jamie solved the mystery and found the factory that turned the soap into bubble bath. A few days later, Princess Ryan had a happy birthday, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
