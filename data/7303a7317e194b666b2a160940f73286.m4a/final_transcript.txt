Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Isaac. Isaac's house looked like a regular house, and Isaac slept on what seemed like a regular bed. Isaac had a regular pillow and a regular comfy blanket. Everything about Isaac's house looked normal. But in Isaac's house, there was a secret door. The secret door was inside a closet, hidden behind some old stuff. The secret door was small, and the grownups in Isaac's house didn't even know it existed. But one day, Isaac discovered it. While playing in the closet, Isaac pushed aside an old suitcase and saw a magic door behind it. The magic door was covered in glitter, and it had a doorknob made out of a lollipop. There was also a lollipop key that fit into the lollipop doorknob to open the door.

Isaac told his big sister Violet that they should go on an adventure through the magic door together. So Isaac and Violet packed a snack and opened the magic door. On the other side of the door, Isaac and Violet saw a waterfall. But instead of water, the waterfall was flowing with orange juice! There was also a beautiful rainbow behind the magic door. As they stepped into this magical land, they saw many penguins, and one of the penguins was in charge. The head penguin welcomed Isaac and Violet into their magical world.

When they stepped into the magical land, they noticed ketchup on the ground, and their feet turned red from stepping in it. Isaac asked Violet, "Why is there so much ketchup on the floor?" A nearby penguin overheard Isaac and replied, "Because penguins love ketchup!" Isaac said, "Oh."

The penguins invited Isaac and Violet to join them for a special penguin dinner. Isaac had never eaten dinner with penguins before, and the penguins had some unique dinner rules. At penguin dinners, dessert was always served first. After dessert, the penguins enjoyed a delicious ice cream noodle dish, perfect for the cold North and South Poles where penguins live.

Isaac asked the penguins if he and Violet could try some ice cream noodles, and the penguins agreed. As they ate their ice cream noodles, the penguins explained that in Penguin Land, dinner was eaten while splashing around in puddles with their feet. So Isaac and Violet joined the penguins in splashing in the ketchup puddles as they ate. After dinner, it was party time! The penguins played instruments, danced, and had a great time. Some penguins even wore their pajamas to the party.

Just as everyone was having the most fun, they saw helicopters in the sky. The helicopters looked like firefighter helicopters because they were red and had hoses attached to them. Isaac asked Violet why the helicopters were there, and Violet asked a penguin if there was a fire. The penguin explained that the firefighter helicopters were there to squirt out ketchup in case they ran out, which would make the penguins sad.

As the firefighter helicopter sprayed ketchup on the ground, some police helicopters arrived. The police helicopters had sirens and fork-like propellers. They announced, "Alert! Attention everyone in the Magic Kingdom. Bedtime is approaching." Violet told Isaac that this meant they needed to go back through the magic door.

Isaac and Violet returned through the magic door to their regular house and told their parents about their amazing adventure. They put on their pajamas and went to sleep. Isaac, Violet, and their family lived happily ever after. The end.
