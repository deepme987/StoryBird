Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a seven-year-old girl named Olive. Olive was very lucky because a package arrived in the mail. When she opened the package, she found magic markers and some paper. Olive didn't know how the magic markers worked, so she decided to try drawing on the paper with them. She used the white magic marker to draw snow, the green one to draw a tortoise (which is like a turtle), and black and white to draw a penguin. Olive was very good at drawing, so the tortoise looked like a big turtle, the snow looked deep with snowballs, and the penguin was waddling in the snow.

Olive was drawing with her magic markers when she asked her mom how they were magical. Her mom said she didn't know. Olive had an idea to put something shiny and reflective on the paper with the penguin, snow, and tortoise. She went to the kitchen, got some tinfoil, and placed it on top of the paper. Suddenly, the things she drew appeared on the wall of her house! Olive turned around and saw a penguin walking on the wall, just like in a movie. There was also snow all over the wall, and when Olive touched it, it was cold. The penguin jumped and slid on the snow, all happening on Olive's kitchen wall.

Olive decided to draw on another magic paper. She drew a crown, a princess, and a treasure. Olive used many colors for the treasure, including gold. She made a beautiful crown with jewelry, pretty rocks, and twinkly colors. She also drew a treasure box. When Olive finished drawing, she tried to find the tinfoil, but it was gone. The penguin had taken it but told Olive she could have it back. Olive took the tinfoil from the penguin and placed it over the new paper. All the new things she drew – the crown, the princess, the treasure – appeared on Olive's ceiling.

Olive tried to jump up to get the treasure, but she couldn't reach. The penguin offered to help, so Olive lifted the penguin to the ceiling to reach the treasure. But as they reached for it, the princess said, "No, don't take the treasure." Olive told the penguin to stop because the princess asked them not to. The princess had a jump rope and invited Olive to play on the ceiling. Olive asked why they couldn't take the treasure down, and the princess explained that it would crash if it fell. She suggested playing jump rope first, then using the rope to lower the treasure box safely. Olive agreed.

Olive played jump rope with the princess, who had a long shadow jump rope. It was like a big shadow that went over the ceiling and walls, and Olive had to jump when the shadow was under her. Olive got really good at this game, and the princess told her she was doing a great job. Olive invited the penguin to join, and the penguin talked like a toddler, making Olive laugh.

After playing, Olive decided to take a break. She put on her pajamas and put away her magic markers, planning to draw more things another day. Olive and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
