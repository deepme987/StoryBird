Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Nora. Nora lived in a fairy princess rainbow land where the streets were made of sprinkles and the sidewalks were made of graham crackers. In the fairy princess land, all the horses were big and tall, and some even had pink diamonds on their heads. There were also lots of magical things in this land. Everyone who lived there could have either a pet puppy or a pet cat, and they got to choose. So one day, Nora asked her mom what she should choose. Nora's mom told her that since they were in such a magical land, they should go to the end of the rainbow and open a treasure box to see if there was a kitty cat or a dog inside.

Nora and her mom hopped into their flying car, which looked like a unicorn because instead of wheels, it had legs and big bird-like wings. The flying car took them to the end of the rainbow. When they arrived, they saw a golden treasure box. It was locked and so heavy that nobody could move it. Nora and her mom got out of the magical flying car and saw that glitter started to float up in the air when Nora stepped on the ground. They held hands and looked at the golden treasure box.

As they were looking at the treasure box, many fairies came out from their hiding places. Some were hiding in trees behind leaves, while others came down from the clouds. The fairies slid down the rainbow and gathered around the treasure chest, where Nora and her mom were waiting. The fairies danced in the air, making so much magic that Nora and her mom could float in the air for a few seconds just by thinking about jumping. They floated as high as a step stool.

While they were floating, the fairies landed on the golden treasure box, making it glow. Something special was happening inside, but they couldn't tell what it was. A fairy used her magic wand to unlock the treasure box, and Nora opened it to find a pretend plastic kitty cat. It looked like a toy from a store, but when Nora took it out, the fairies waved their magic wands and turned the plastic toy into a real kitty cat. It had fur, ears, and a tail, and soon it opened its eyes and said, "Meow."

Nora's magical land was truly amazing. As the kitty cat meowed, the rainbows flashed colors, turning into a disco light rainbow. The fairies were so happy, and the kitty cat meowed at the sight. One of the fairies whispered a secret to Nora: if she fed the kitty cat a doggy treat, it would turn into a dog, and if she fed it a kitty treat, it would turn back into a cat. Nora asked how to get a dog treat, and a fairy said, "Poof padoof," waving her magic wand to make a dog treat appear.

Nora gave the treat to the kitty cat, and as it ate, it turned into a puppy, wagging its tail and barking. Nora told the puppy they would go on many adventures together, and the puppy agreed. They hugged, and Nora's mom praised her for turning the kitty cat into a puppy. Nora said she would turn it back into a cat later for a special adventure. They all agreed that living in this magical land was so much fun.

For lunch, Nora wanted some magic food that looked like a carrot but tasted like ice cream and gave special powers. Nora and her mom found a magic food restaurant three blocks away and went there to eat. They enjoyed their magic food and lived happily ever after. The end.
