Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Jonah. One morning, Jonah was eating some cereal for breakfast. He had milk in his bowl and poured some Lucky Charms on top. Some of the milk splashed out, but he told everyone it would be okay. Jonah used his spoon to mix the Lucky Charms in his bowl. As he mixed, he saw a unicorn and a dragon lucky charm. They started to swim in the milk all by themselves. Soon, the unicorn and dragon charms climbed out of the bowl and walked next to Jonah's cereal.

As they walked, Jonah noticed they were getting bigger. The unicorn grew to the size of a kitty cat, while the dragon, made of marshmallow, grew even bigger. It stepped off the table and walked around Jonah's house. Jonah's little brother Jesse saw the dragon too. Jonah called his mom and dad to show them the dragon that came from his Lucky Charms. His dad, Steve, saw that the dragon was friendly and made of marshmallow. The dragon was red with a white stripe from its nose to its tail. Steve suggested Jonah try riding the dragon, and Jonah agreed.

Jonah climbed onto the dragon, which started heading for the front door. The dragon opened the door and went outside. Jonah knew the dragon was about to fly, so he found a marshmallow seatbelt on its back and buckled up. A steering wheel appeared, and Jonah used it to guide the dragon. The dragon spread its wings, said "Take off," and flew into the sky.

The dragon flew to Seattle, where Jonah saw an emergency. All the cars had disappeared, and people were riding horses instead. The cars had turned into toy cars, and the city looked like the olden days. Jonah flew above Seattle on the marshmallow dragon, but the horses below were scared of the dragon. Jonah wanted to tell them not to be afraid, but they couldn't hear him from the sky.

Jonah had an idea. He told the dragon to land on a big boat near Seattle. Once they landed, the horses calmed down. Jonah told the dragon to wear a raincoat and a unicorn mask to disguise itself. The dragon agreed, and they found a big raincoat and a unicorn mask with a horn. When they returned to Seattle, the horses were happy to see a unicorn, which they considered the king or queen of horses.

Jonah asked the disguised dragon to speak to the horses in their language and find out what happened to the cars. The dragon neighed to the horses, and they neighed back. The dragon told Jonah that the ocean around Seattle had turned into milk, with Lucky Charms floating on top. A giant had poured milk into the ocean and stirred it with a spoon, causing the cars to shrink into toys and horses to appear from trees.

Jonah realized that a giant had seen him eating Lucky Charms that morning and copied him. The giant had poured milk and Lucky Charms into the ocean to make his own cereal. Jonah flew home on the magic marshmallow dragon and told his parents they should never eat Lucky Charms again. Jonah and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
