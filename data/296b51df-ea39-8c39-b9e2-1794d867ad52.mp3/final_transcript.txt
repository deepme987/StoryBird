Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a girl named Robin. One day, Robin was swimming in a big pool with her floaties. She held on to one of the tubes, and suddenly, she noticed a big drain at the bottom of the pool. Everything, including Robin, got sucked under the ground.

When Robin found herself underground, the pool closed up, and she was stuck. Instead of seeing dirt above her, she saw disco lights. She looked around and discovered that flashlights were coming out of her eyes. Wherever she looked, there was light. Nearby, she saw mermaids eating big bowls of Cheerios with milk next to an underground pool. There was also a hot tub and a roller coaster entrance, where the seats looked like big shoes.

Robin decided to swim with her floaty device to the roller coaster. When she got there, there was no one to take her ticket. So, she put her ticket in a big mailbox. As soon as she closed the mailbox, the shoe opened up, and Robin climbed in. Suddenly, sirens went off, and the roller coaster started to move.

The roller coaster went downhill, deeper underground, making a "ChuChu" sound. It went faster and faster until it entered a tunnel with stars on all sides. When the tunnel ended, the shoe opened up, and the roller coaster stopped in a room with no exit.

This room was full of little bubbles. When Robin stepped on a bubble, it turned inside out, creating a big poppet room. The floor and ceiling had bubbles. Robin started jumping, hitting bubbles with her hands and feet. She moved sideways, turning all the bubbles inside out.

After Robin finished with the bubbles, the room exploded into glitter, and she found herself falling into a big pile of snow. When she landed, she saw a unicorn at the bottom of a ski hill and a big birthday cake with pink frosting. It wasn't Robin's birthday.

Robin slid down the hill and smelled the birthday cake. Suddenly, a fish jumped out and swam through the air. Robin put on skis and chased the fish down the ski slope until they reached a giant frozen pond.

The ice on the pond was thick, but Robin carefully took off her skis and stepped onto it. She followed the fish and found a big cat all alone in the middle of the frozen pond. Robin picked up the cat and held it in her arms.

Just then, the mermaids from earlier arrived on the shoe roller coaster. They had popped the poppet room and were now covered in glitter. They joined Robin on the frozen lake, and she asked them if they knew kittens lived down there. The mermaids invited Robin to their special mermaid castle.

Robin asked where it was, and one of the mermaids whispered magic words into the ice. A big crack appeared in the middle of the pond, and the ice and water parted, revealing a big slide.

Robin and the mermaids went down the slide, one of them carrying the kitten. At the bottom, they found a magical fountain with three streams of water. Anything that went between the streams could float, change size, age, and even gain magical powers.

One of the mermaids asked Robin if she would go through the magic streams. Robin wasn't sure, but suddenly, the kitten jumped between the streams. It changed size, turned into a lion, aged, and even became a talking cat.

The cat told Robin to look up, and she saw a rope. Robin pulled the rope, and suddenly she was back in the original pool, floating with her family. Robin and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
