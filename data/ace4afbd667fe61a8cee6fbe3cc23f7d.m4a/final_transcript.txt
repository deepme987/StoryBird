Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Adiat. When he woke up, he couldn't remember if his real name was Adiat or Adiat. That day, everyone started calling him the wrong name. Some people called him Simon, some called him Salam, and some of his friends called him Mohammed or Jacob. Adiat decided he had to find out why everyone was being silly and calling him different names. So he went with his brothers, Zair and Isak, outside their house.

When they got outside, they found a bunch of horses pulling chariots. Inside the chariots were many people, and it looked like the olden days. Adiat, Zair, and Isak watched as a person came out of a chariot. The person went up to Adiat and said, "Adiat, I have a secret that nobody else knows, not even you. You are really a king from a town called Meleku, and everyone from Meleku is a king."

Zair and Isak laughed because they knew Adiat wasn't really a king. But the people gave Adiat a crown. They opened a box from the chariot, and the horses neighed as they revealed the crown. It was made of gold, had many jewels, and was very heavy. The person put it on Adiat's head and announced, "Hear ye, hear ye. We have a new king of the whole land, and his name is Adiat." Then the man went back into his carriage, and the horses neighed as they left. Zair and Isak thought it was very silly.

As Zair talked to Adiat, something happened. A snake appeared on the ground and slithered over Adiat's brothers, Zair and Isak. It wasn't a scary snake that bit, but a magic snake that made them as small as a baby's bottle. Adiat looked around and saw that Zair and Isak were tiny, with small hands, feet, eyes, and belly buttons. Their clothes and shoes stayed the same size, so they were inside their shoes.

Adiat picked up Zair and Isak, put them on his shoulders next to the golden crown, and walked around the land. He saw many sheep walking around the sand and going to the camels. Adiat decided to follow the sheep and bring his brothers on shoulder rides to the camels. As he carried them, Zair and Isak cried, "Help, Adiat! We're so little. Can you make us big again?"

Adiat turned his crown around, looked at Zair, and said, "Yes, I have to find a magic animal that will make you big again." He told Isak not to worry and that he would save the day. Adiat walked with his crown and found a cape on the side of the street. It was furry, like a kitty cat, with red beads inside and a big button in the front. Adiat put on the cape, and Zair and Isak went on top of it. Adiat marched on to find a magic thing that would make his brothers grow again.

He followed a dusty trail until he found a big hole. It was so big that it could fit three fire trucks with their ladders out. Adiat asked, "I am the king of this land. Will anyone tell me what happened and how this hole came to be?" A birdie flew down, tweeting around Zair and Isak, and landed on Adiat's crown. The birdie said it was a talking bird and explained that there used to be a toy factory there, but it fell underground, leaving a big hole.

Adiat asked the birdie if it knew any magic that could make Zair and Isak big again. The birdie whistled, saying that when it made that sound, a friendly wizard would come and help. As the birdie whistled, a wizard appeared from the other side of the hole.

The wizard wore a big hat, had a long beard, walked with a cane, and had pointy shoes. He could walk in the air and went up to Adiat, saying, "Adiat, I see that your brothers Zair and Isak are small." Adiat agreed and mentioned that everyone was pronouncing his name wrong that day. The wizard said he had magic to make Zair and Isak big again. He took out his wand and said, "Avra kevra." Just like that, Zair and Isak grew back to their normal size.

They got off Adiat's shoulders and walked beside him, telling him he was the hero of the day. The wizard went away, and Adiat kept his crown and cape on as they walked home. Zair and Isak sang, "Yay, yay! You did such a great job today!" Adiat and his brothers lived happily ever after in a new house on the beach. Whenever they wanted to go somewhere, there was a special plane on the beach that took them there.
