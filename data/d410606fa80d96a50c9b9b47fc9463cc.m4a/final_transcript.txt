Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was an eight-year-old girl named Vasilisa, and her birthday was coming up next week. All week, she wondered what her birthday present would be. Finally, her birthday arrived, and she had a cake with eight candles on it. When she blew out the candles after everyone sang "Happy Birthday," something special happened - the candles twinkled, and she made a wish for a magic marker.

When Vasilisa opened her eyes and her mom started to cut the cake, they found something magical inside the birthday cake. It was a magic marker! Vasilisa asked her mom for some paper because she wanted to try out the magic marker and see what it did. Her mom said, "First, eat some cake." But Vasilisa replied, "No, don't worry, because I'm going to draw more cake with my magic marker, and then we can have more cake." Her mom agreed and gave her two pieces of paper.

On the first piece of paper, Vasilisa drew another birthday cake. Then, poof! It got a little foggy, and suddenly there was a second birthday cake. Next, she decided to draw a trailer outside, and poof, a real trailer appeared! Vasilisa realized she could have any toy she wanted, so she thought of a good idea. She decided to draw a rainbow, and guess what happened? A real rainbow appeared that would stay with her and go wherever she went!

The rainbow appeared in Vasilisa's living room, where she was having her birthday cake. It had a slide on it, and Vasilisa, her baby brother Lucas, and her sister Palina slid down the real-life rainbow that went outside. The rainbow ended in a big ocean, but it wasn't dangerous because Vasilisa drew a hole around the water. So there was a part of the ocean with no water in it, and that's where the rainbow went. She got to go all the way to the bottom of the ocean by sliding down the magical rainbow slide.

At the bottom of the ocean, Vasilisa discovered an underwater city. It was very silly because there were octopus submarines floating around the city. Vasilisa held onto an octopus submarine as it gave her a tour. She saw sharks cooking eggs for breakfast, starfish that lit up like real stars, and a fish called a moonfish, shaped like a moon and glowing in the dark.

Vasilisa kept holding onto the octopus submarine and saw a lionfish that looked like a real lion but had flippers. Instead of roaring, the lionfish sneezed! Vasilisa asked the octopus what would happen if someone got sick in the underwater city. Was there a doctor? The octopus took her to a doctor's office near some colorful rocks. The doctor was a penguin dressed up as a doctor with a stethoscope and lots of doctor things. The penguin doctor told Vasilisa not to worry because his shots didn't hurt, and he could give her a bandaid made of Scotch tape if she ever had a boo-boo.

Vasilisa remembered her magic marker and tried to see if it would work in the underwater city. She decided to draw a cat with a big hat on a rock at the bottom of the ocean. After she finished drawing, poof! A cat with a hat appeared, but it couldn't talk underwater. Vasilisa knew she needed an emergency way to get out of the ocean, so she drew an elevator. The cat in the hat, Vasilisa, Lucas, and Palina all went into the elevator and whooshed up from the bottom of the ocean to the top.

When they reached the top, they found themselves on a magic island. The island had snow that wasn't cold but hot, and a volcano that was upside down with apple juice inside instead of magma. Vasilisa realized it was getting late, and she needed to go home to eat her cake while it was still fresh. So she drew a big bird with her magic marker, and the bird turned real, giving Vasilisa, Lucas, Palina, and their mom a ride back to their house.

When they got back home, Vasilisa decided to draw a special thank you note for her mom. She drew the thank you note with letters, and her mom said, "That is so special!" The real thank you letters started to float around the house, and everyone was so proud of Vasilisa on her birthday. Vasilisa and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
