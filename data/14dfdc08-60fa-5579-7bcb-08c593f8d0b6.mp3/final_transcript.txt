Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. They lived in a magical land full of jewels where it was always bright and sunny. The sun never set, so when people wanted to sleep, they had to close their curtains to keep the light out. Instead of a regular sun, there was a big, shiny jewel that always sparkled in the sky. The sky was filled with colorful crystals, just like the ones you might find in a cave.

Jonah and Jesse lived in a house with a grass-covered roof, just like all their friends' houses. They called them rabbit houses, even though they were really for people. The houses were tunnels in the ground, and the kids in this special land loved to slide through the tunnels and discover secret passageways. Some were so small that grownups couldn't fit through them, so they never found out about them.

One day, Jonah and Jesse went exploring and found a playground made entirely of Lego. The swings, slides, climbing structures, and even the monkey bars were all made of Lego. The monkey bars were a bit pokey, so the kids had to wear special padded gloves to play on them. Some kids chose to wear Lego gloves instead, so they could stick to the bars and easily cross them. The playground was a lot of fun for everyone.

As Jonah and Jesse played, they heard an alarm bell ringing. It got closer and closer until they saw that it was announcing the arrival of the king. The king had promised to bring a special fair to the town for all the kids to enjoy. Jonah and Jesse watched as a parade of people, animals, and flags approached the Lego playground. When the king arrived, they noticed he looked just like a regular person, except he had rabbit ears, just like the people in their land.

Jonah and Jesse wondered what they should do, and the king pointed to some magical blocks in his chariot. The blocks could build themselves into any shape you wanted, just by drawing a picture. Jonah and Jesse took the blocks to the sandbox and started building a sandcastle. As they built, the magical blocks arranged themselves into the same shape as the sandcastle. Jesse even added a moat and a bridge, and the blocks followed his design.

Suddenly, when Jesse touched one of the blocks, his whole body turned into the same material as the block. He still looked like a kid, but he was made of block material. Jonah told Jesse not to go into the block castle, and when he touched Jesse, he turned back into a regular person. The block castle then transformed into a candy castle, and everyone, including the king, cheered for Jonah and Jesse, thinking they had performed magic. But even Jonah and Jesse didn't know how the magical blocks worked.

Jonah, Jesse, and everyone in the town lived happily ever after. The end.
