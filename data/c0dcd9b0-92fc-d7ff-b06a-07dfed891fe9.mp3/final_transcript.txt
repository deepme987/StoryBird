Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Vedant. After dinner one day, Vedant decided to help his parents wash the dishes with soap and water. So he got a little stool to step on and placed it right in front of the kitchen sink. Then Vedant climbed up on the stool, turned on the sink, and water started to come out. But the water that came out that day was not regular water. It was a special kind of water sand. The water sand was colorful and felt like water when you touched it, but it looked like colorful sand.

Vedant asked his parents if he could clean the dishes using the new kind of water sand. His parents said it was okay. So Vedant rolled up his sleeves to keep them dry and began washing the dishes with the colorful Sandwater. While doing so, he decided to collect some of the colorful water in a cup. He filled the cup and then poured it into a bowl in the sink. Vedant asked his mom if he could use a spoon to mix it around, and she said okay.

As Vedant mixed the colorful, sandy water in the bowl, a rainbow-colored jellyfish with four legs like a kitty cat appeared. The jellyfish climbed out of the bowl, holding an umbrella, and told Vedant that he had found magical water from the middle of the earth. This special water could make things come true when poured from a cup into a bowl. Vedant asked how it worked and where it came from.

The rainbow jellyfish twirled his umbrella and led Vedant to his bathtub, explaining that there were secret pools of colorful water under deserts and sandboxes. This water was responsible for the birth of the first animals in the world, like their great-great-great-grandparents. At least, that's what the jellyfish told Vedant.

The jellyfish wanted to take a bath with Vedant, but his dad said they needed to do laundry first. So Vedant brought his dirty clothes to the washing machine, and the jellyfish went in too. When Vedant's mom turned on the machine, the water turned into colorful sand, making the clothes super clean in just 2 seconds. As they took the clothes out, they saw them folding by themselves, thanks to the helpful jellyfish. The jellyfish even dried the clothes with a blow of his breath.

Vedant asked his parents if he could now have a bath with the colorful walking jellyfish, and they agreed. They filled the bathtub with the colorful sandy water, and Vedant played with a boat that turned into a monster truck boat when the water touched it. The monster truck boat had a water gun that squirted colorful sandy water, making it lots of fun.

Vedant asked his parents if he could turn on the water even more, and they said okay. The magical colorful jellyfish turned the water on full blast, and rockets came out of the faucet, creating bubbles in the colorful, sandy bath. The bath was the most fun Vedant ever had, and the jellyfish even protected his eyes from shampoo and conditioner.

After the bath, Vedant watched the colorful sandy water go down the drain. The jellyfish, colorful rockets, and monster truck toy stayed behind. The jellyfish told Vedant he could keep him as a pet and use the toys for future baths. Vedant said thank you, and he and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
