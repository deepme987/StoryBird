Once upon a time, long ago, there was a three-year-old girl named Cheyenne who had a special friend named Jethro. Cheyenne and Jethro lived in Lafayette, California, and they loved to play lots of fun games. When their mom read a book, they played a pointing game where they tried to find pictures in the book. Whoever found a picture with a basket first was the winner. Sometimes Cheyenne won, sometimes Jethro won, and sometimes there was no basket in the picture, so they had to find birdies instead.

One day, as their mom read a special book, Cheyenne and Jethro started to feel sleepy. Cheyenne said, "I'm not going to close my eyes." But just as she said that, she closed her eyes a little and began to dream.

In Cheyenne's dream, it was very cold with lots of snow and ice on the ground. She was inside a real igloo at the North Pole, and Jethro was there too. They shivered and said, "Brr, it's so cold in this igloo!" Then they had an idea to say, "I want a blanket." But nothing happened. So they tried something silly: Cheyenne put her hands on Jethro's head, and Jethro put his hands on Cheyenne's head. They said, "Blankie, blankie, we need a green blankie." Suddenly, the igloo changed colors and became rainbow-colored with a rainbow on top. A green blanket appeared, and Cheyenne named it "Greenie Blankie."

The blanket was magical because it made them warm right away, even if it only covered a small part of them. Cheyenne and Jethro shared the blankie and decided to explore the North Pole. They rode on the blankie, which started to fly! As they flew, the blankie asked if they wanted to go on a sled ride. They excitedly said, "Yes! Yippee!" The blanket turned into a sled, and they slid down a hill.

At the bottom of the hill, they found a huge pile of presents, bigger than a tall building. An old man with a beard was nearby, writing things down on a list. Cheyenne and Jethro wondered who he was, but they didn't ask.

Just then, a chicken hopped through the snow. It told them it used to share the magic blanket, which kept it warm in the cold North Pole. The chicken asked if it could go for a sled ride too, and Cheyenne and Jethro agreed.

They all slid down a snowy hill towards a lake. At the lake, they saw a bubbling, unfrozen part because of hot lava underneath. The magic blanket, Greenie, knew how to float and flew them safely over the hot lava without getting too warm.

On the other side of the lake, they saw reindeer looking for berries. The reindeer were eating a special berry called a Stormtrooper berry, which looked like a robot soldier but tasted like a yummy gummy bear. The reindeer and the chicken enjoyed eating these special berries.

Cheyenne and Jethro decided to go back to the big pile of presents to see if Santa was there. They saw someone flying away on a sled with toys, but they couldn't tell who it was. They also saw reindeer eating the gummy bear-shaped Stormtrooper berries and flying towards children's houses.

Cheyenne and Jethro went back home and told their mom about their adventure. She said, "That is very interesting." And Cheyenne and Jethro lived happily ever after. The end. Share this story with your friends, because they'll like it too!
