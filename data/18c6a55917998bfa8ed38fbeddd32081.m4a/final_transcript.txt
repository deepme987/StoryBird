Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Michaela. One day, Michaela looked in the mailbox and was so happy because she saw a letter with an M for Michaela on it. She said, "Mom, look, somebody sent a letter just for me. Can I open it?" Michaela's mom agreed, and Michaela carefully opened the envelope. Inside, she found a silver ticket that said "North Pole" and had a picture of snow on it. Michaela's mom looked at the ticket and said, "Guess what? You got a ticket to the North Pole! Later today, a special North Pole helicopter will come to our house, land on our roof, and take us to the North Pole!"

Michaela told her mom that they would need to pack their coats, gloves, and snow boots because it would be very cold in the North Pole. They packed all their warmest clothes, climbed onto the roof, and saw a special bubble helicopter. The helicopter was unique because it made bubbles while flying, leaving a trail of bubbles behind it. All the kids in the cities it passed would look up and say, "Oh, the bubble helicopter is coming!"

The captain told Michaela and her mom they were ready to go. They climbed in, and Michaela sat in a special helicopter kid seat with a steering wheel. When she turned the wheel, it told the pilot which way to turn the helicopter. Michaela and her mom flew in the bubble helicopter, making lots of bubbles as they traveled over California, north through Canada, and finally to the North Pole.

When they arrived, Michaela saw that part of the North Pole was made of vanilla ice cream instead of snow. There were hills and rivers of ice cream, and beaches made of sprinkles. The bubble helicopter landed next to a milky, creamy river, and they saw kids playing in the rainbow sprinkles, building a sprinkle castle.

Michaela told her mom that the first thing she wanted to do was eat. They got out of the helicopter and saw a big kitty cat wearing clothes and glasses, with big snow boots and a silly, long elephant-like nose. The kitty cat walked up to them and said, "Welcome to the North Pole. Do you have your ticket?" Michaela's mom showed the silver ticket, and the kitty cat welcomed them.

Michaela asked if the kitty cat could talk, and it whispered a secret that only she could hear. The kitty cat then told Michaela they needed to make a polar bear out of frosting. Michaela and her mom helped draw a polar bear with frosting, and it magically turned into a real frosting polar bear!

In this part of the North Pole, polar bears had an important job: they fetched ice cream cones for kids with silver tickets. So, the frosting polar bear went to the ice cream cone factory, got a cone for Michaela, and filled it with ice cream and rainbow sprinkles. Michaela loved it!

Soon, the pilot said it was time to go home. Michaela and her mom climbed back into the bubble helicopter, taking the silver ticket with them. The helicopter blew bubbles all over California as they returned home. Michaela and her family lived happily ever after. The end. Thanks for listening to this wonderful story.
