Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two siblings named Lena and Ziyad. They lived in a desert near a large castle. The castle had tall towers and beautiful outdoor spaces where people would dance, sing, and wear fancy costumes. It also had bows and arrows on top to protect against any enemies, but Lena and Ziyad had never seen any.

One day, Lena's mom asked her to go to the market and buy some special fruit. Lena took her little brother Ziyad, and they went to the busy market. It was a fun place with people selling spices, different kinds of food, and fruit. They met an old lady with white hair and five ponytails stacked on top of each other. She wore a colorful necklace made of jewels and was selling fruit while dancing with a hula hoop. When she saw Lena and Ziyad, she asked if they wanted any fruit. They said yes, so the old lady gave Lena a date and Ziyad a fig.

On their way back home, Lena and Ziyad showed their mom the fig and date they got. Their mom said these were special fruits and told them to cover them with a towel and go to sleep to see what they would turn into in the morning.

So Lena and Ziyad went to sleep that night. When they woke up the next morning, before brushing their teeth and eating cereal, they wanted to check on the fig and date. In the kitchen, they found a unicorn under one towel and a dinosaur under the other. The fig had turned into a unicorn, and the date had turned into a dinosaur. These creatures were small, about the size of Lena's hands.

At first, Ziyad wasn't gentle, but Lena reminded him to be careful with the baby unicorn and dinosaur. The unicorn sat on Lena's shoulders, and the dinosaur sat on Ziyad's. They went outside, away from the market and the castle, and headed to the desert. They opened the city gate and entered the desert with their new friends on their shoulders.

A strong wind blew, carrying lots of sand, making it hard for Lena and Ziyad to see. Suddenly, the unicorn squeaked, and the dinosaur roared. A magic carpet appeared and came right to them. Lena and Ziyad rode the magic carpet with their unicorn and dinosaur, flying high above the sandstorm. From up there, they could see the castle and the desert.

Far away, they saw a giant meteor falling from outer space, which could crash and make all dinosaurs and unicorns disappear. Lena and Ziyad decided to send their magic carpet to outer space to stop the meteor. They got off the carpet, and luckily, their dinosaur had wings, and the little unicorn could carry both of them. They all landed safely on the ground.

Lena and Ziyad went home and told their parents about their desert adventure. They had stopped a meteor from hitting Earth and saved the dinosaurs and unicorns. Their parents were so happy and let them keep the dinosaur and unicorn as pets. From then on, Lena and Ziyad were the only kids in town with a pet unicorn and dinosaur. They all lived happily ever after. The end.
