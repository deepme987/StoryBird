Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a nine-year-old boy named Xander. Xander loved playing with his friends, but sometimes they didn't share with him, and he felt lonely. For example, his friend Corey wouldn't share his water gun, even though Xander loved water guns so much. Xander told Corey that if he shared, Corey could join his family on a trip to the zoo. Corey decided to share, and they both went to the zoo.

When they arrived at the zoo, their parents told them they would have lunch there, with hot dogs, chicken nuggets, and maybe even an ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert. Corey and Xander were really excited. As they were eating lunch, they heard the sound of an elephant stomping around the zoo. Everyone started running away from the elephant.

Xander told his parents, "Quick, there's an elephant coming! We have to move!" Corey, Xander, and Xander's parents moved away from their lunch spot. Before they could grab their ice cream sandwiches, the elephant picked up Xander's with its trunk and started eating it.

Xander had never seen an elephant eat an ice cream sandwich before, and what happened next was even more surprising. There was a kitty cat on top of the elephant, getting a ride! The elephant shared some of Xander's ice cream sandwich with the kitty cat. The kitty cat tried to steer the elephant out of the zoo.

But as they were leaving, the zookeeper came running and went to the gift shop, where there were lots of stuffed animals. The elephant wanted some, so it broke the gift shop window and grabbed a few. One of the stuffed animals, named Babaloo, was secretly alive. Xander and Corey had seen Babaloo before but didn't know he was really alive.

The elephant put Babaloo on its back, next to the kitty cat. Then Babaloo came to life and started talking. He said, "Everyone, the elephant wants me to speak for him. We're leaving the zoo to go to Africa and live on the savannah." The zookeeper heard Babaloo and was surprised that a stuffed animal could talk. Realizing it was an emergency, he called for help on his radio.

Soon, rescue helicopters and police cars arrived, making loud "woo, woo, woo" sounds. The helicopter threw a net down on the elephant, kitty cat, and Babaloo, who were sad to be caught. They started chewing through the ropes to escape. Before the police and zookeeper could catch them, they got away.

They ran to a forest far from the city and the zoo. In the forest, the elephant knocked over a big rock and found worms and lots of ants underneath. The kitty cat wanted to catch the ants, so it jumped off the elephant and started pouncing on them. But more and more ants appeared, covering the forest floor like a carpet.

The kitty cat and Babaloo climbed back onto the elephant as the ants grew into a huge pile as big as the elephant. The elephant had to run away and found a lake. Ants don't like water, so the elephant sucked up water in its trunk and squirted it at the ants like a water gun.

Xander and Corey, watching from the edge of the forest with binoculars, realized they could help by sharing their water gun. They went to the lake, filled up their water guns, and squirted the ants until they disappeared back underground. The elephant, Babaloo, and the kitty cat were so grateful for their help.

Even though kitty cats don't like water, the kitty cat didn't get wet because Xander and Corey only squirted the ants. The elephant also squirted water from its trunk at the ants.

Xander and Corey had saved the day, so the elephant offered them a ride. They climbed onto the elephant, and it took them back to the zoo. When they arrived, the zookeeper and everyone else cheered and called them heroes.

Xander and Corey lived happily ever after. Babaloo, the alive stuffed animal, went home with Xander. Every night, Xander and Babaloo would share secrets that grown-ups couldn't understand. Xander and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
