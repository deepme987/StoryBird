Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Jesse. Jesse loved to watch movies, especially cartoons. One day, after watching a cartoon, he fell asleep on the couch in front of the TV. While he was sleeping, a dog from the cartoon came out of the TV and woke Jesse up by licking his face. Jesse pushed the dog away and said, "Don't do that." But when he tried to touch the dog, his hand went right through it because it wasn't a real dog; it had come out of the TV.

Jesse asked, "Hey, why can't I touch you?" The dog told Jesse to stand up and look in a mirror. Jesse got up and walked on the floor, which felt very cold because it had turned into a giant ice cube. He walked to a mirror and when he looked at his reflection, he saw that he had turned into a cartoon character, and the real Jesse was gone.

In the mirror, Jesse could see that he was actually inside the TV. On the other side of the TV, his big brother Jonah was holding a remote control. Jonah was about to turn off the TV, but Jesse didn't want him to because then he would be turned off too. So Jesse shouted, "Jonah, don't turn off the TV, because I'm inside it!" Jonah said, "What? Really?" He looked at the TV and saw that Jesse had really turned into a cartoon and was inside the TV.

Jonah said, "Hold on, I'll go get Mom and Dad to help." He ran to find their parents, Steve and Amanda, and told them, "Jesse is inside the TV!" They went to look and saw that Jesse was really in the TV. Steve said, "Jesse, I'll try to grab you out of the TV." But when he tried, he fell into the TV too.

Amanda tried to grab Steve, but Jesse said, "No, Mom, don't do that. You might fall in too." But it was too late, and Amanda fell into the TV. Jonah decided to use a fishing line to try to get them out. He didn't want to make the same mistake as his parents, so he got a fishing rod and cast it into the TV, near Steve, Amanda, and Jesse. He told them not to touch the sharp hook, but to hold onto the fishing line. Jonah cut off the hook with scissors and threw the line into the TV.

When Steve grabbed the fishing line, Jonah started pulling. It was like a tug of war between Steve, Amanda, and Jesse inside the TV, and Jonah outside. Steve was stronger because he was a grown-up, but the TV made him weaker. Jonah realized he might get pulled into the TV, so he pulled as hard as he could. The TV fell down and cracked open.

Jesse, Steve, and Amanda got out of the TV, but they were shadows on the floor, not real people. Jonah could see their heads and some of their feet, but he couldn't get their whole bodies back. That's when their kitty cat came in. The cat stepped on Steve's shadow, and he said, "Ouch." The cat jumped onto a light switch and turned on the light, making the shadows disappear for a second. So Jonah had to turn the light back off.

After he turned the light off, there was a knock on the door. Jonah opened it and asked, "Who is it?" It was a cartoon TV repairman with tools. Jonah asked, "Are you here to fix the TV?" The repairman said he had gotten a call from someone inside a TV saying Jesse, Steve, and Amanda were stuck, so he came to help.

The TV repairman saw the fishing line and said, "Oh, you tried the old fishing trick. Smart boy. Your dad must have pulled too hard, and that's why the TV fell." Jonah agreed. The repairman said they needed some special magic and a potion to get Jesse and their parents back. The potion needed ketchup, yellow seeds found in sand, and water.

Jesse told the repairman that Jonah had yellow seeds in his pocket. Jonah took them out, and the repairman mixed them with ketchup and water. Then he shined a flashlight on the mixture and they sang a secret song. They looked in a mirror, which turned into a TV. Steve, Amanda, and Jesse walked out of the TV. When they did, Jesse woke up and realized he had been dreaming. Steve, Amanda, Jonah, and Jesse were all normal, and the whole family lived happily ever after. The end.
