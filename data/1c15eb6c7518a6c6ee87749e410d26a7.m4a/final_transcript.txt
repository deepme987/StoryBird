Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a five-year-old girl named Willa. It was Willa's birthday, and she was very excited because her mom and dad had told her that she would get a very special cake for her birthday. When she walked into the kitchen, she saw lots of toys waiting for her, all wrapped up in pretty gift paper. It was a very special day indeed.

When the cake came out, Willa saw that it was full of candy and looked very delicious. Her mom said she would light the candles and they would sing "Happy Birthday" to Willa. After that, when it was time to blow out the candles, something magical would happen. Willa agreed, and her mom lit the candles. They all sang "Happy Birthday," and Willa blew out the candles. After she did, she saw that the cake really was magical because Willa turned into a grownup! The magic cake allowed whoever's birthday it was to turn into a grownup, and they could become a kid again later.

As a grownup, Willa decided to do lots of fun things. For example, she thought that since she was a grownup now, she could drive a car. Willa the grownup got into her mom's car (which kids shouldn't do without a parent) and went to the store. She bought some ice cream and chocolate, then came back home. It was snowing outside, and when she walked out, she saw a secret that grownups usually don't tell kids. There was a special kind of butterfly that only comes out when it's snowing. The butterfly was all white and made of snow. This was a secret that grownups had, but now Willa knew it too.

Willa thought the snow butterfly was very special, so she went outside to catch it. The butterfly told her it could show her more special secrets, and Willa agreed. The butterfly took Willa on an adventure through a magical forest. In the forest, Willa saw a teeny weeny spider that looked like a kitty cat. It was furry, soft, and cute, with kitty cat ears and a tail, but it still looked like a spider. The little kitty cat spider could talk with its eyes and see with its mouth. It told Willa that since she was with the snow butterfly, it could show her another secret.

Willa followed the snow butterfly and the teeny weeny kitty cat spider to a factory. The spider told grownup Willa that this was where clothes were made. Willa never knew how factories made clothes, but the teeny weeny spider showed her that they used a special kind of thread that came from the teeny weeny spiders. There were no regular machines in the factories, only lots of teeny weeny spiders making threads to sew clothes together. They made kids' pajamas, shirts, jackets, and even boots.

Grownup Willa was very surprised because kids didn't know about this. She wanted to go back home, so the butterfly and little spider walked her back. When she got inside, she saw that it was still her birthday, and she was still really six years old. She wanted to turn back into a six-year-old, so she said goodbye to the magic butterfly and the teeny weeny spider. They went outside near a snowman, and Willa went inside to blow out the rest of her candles.

Willa learned that day that whatever you imagine, you can make real. She ate some of her cake, and it was yummy for a six-year-old girl. She opened a present and found mermaid pajamas. She was happy to get them for her birthday. That night, when she wore the mermaid pajamas, she saw a mermaid floating through the air outside her window. Willa also got other toys for her birthday and had a fun day being a grownup for a little while. But she realized that she wanted to stay a kid, so she told her mom she didn't want any more magic birthday cake. Her mom agreed, and Willa and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
