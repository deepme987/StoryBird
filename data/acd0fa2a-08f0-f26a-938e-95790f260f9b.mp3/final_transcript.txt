Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Zachary. Zachary went to school, and he was in the first grade. His school was kind of big, with a playground outside. Inside the school, there were lots of different classrooms. Each classroom had chairs and a teacher's desk in front. Everyone who went to Zachary's school, including Zachary, thought it was a regular school.

But one day, when Zachary needed to use the bathroom, he asked his teacher for a bathroom pass. His teacher said, okay. Zachary walked through the hallway of his school and accidentally opened the wrong door. It wasn't the bathroom. Behind that door, Zachary saw disco lights and a secret room. He decided to see if there was a little bathroom there. The disco lights made lots of different colors all over the secret room. In the middle of the room, there was a circle drawn on the floor with a blue marker.

Zachary decided to check out what that circle was. He walked to the middle of the secret room and stood in the middle of the blue circle. When he did, all the disco lights went dark. The room became pitch black. Suddenly, the floor started to turn a little bit, and a green light came on from the ceiling. The green light quickly changed colors and became a blue light. Then, there was the sound of crickets chirping, just like outside sometimes in the evening.

Things were getting stranger and stranger. As the light went on and the crickets chirped, the blue circle on the floor disconnected and turned into an elevator that went underground. That's when Zachary discovered that under his school and playground, there was a secret school. The regular kids didn't know about the secret school, but Zachary found it by going through the wrong door and standing in the middle of the blue circle.

When the blue circle went down like an elevator, Zachary was surprised at what he saw. Under the school, there was a much bigger playground than the one outside. This underground playground had water slides with hoses on top, making it more fun to slide down. There were also really cool swings that didn't just go back and forth. The swings in the underground playground went sideways and in circles too.

These swings had buttons on the chains, so you didn't need someone to push you. You could press a forward button, a higher button, a backward button, or side-to-side buttons. Zachary saw lots of food stands all over the secret playground. Big kids were there because it seemed like they knew about this secret playground, but little kids didn't.

Zachary asked one of the big kids if he could get a hot dog. The kid asked if Zachary went to the school on top of the secret playground, and Zachary said yes. The kid told Zachary that if he didn't tell any other kids about the secret playground, he could have a hot dog. Zachary agreed but said he had to go back to class soon because his bathroom break was just for a little bit. The older kid said okay and gave Zachary a hot dog with ketchup on it.

Zachary took a bite of the hot dog right away. It looked like a hot dog, but it tasted like a cupcake. This hot dog was magical! It was really a cupcake with food coloring to make it look like a hot dog. The bun was made of cake, and it must have had magic dust sprinkled in it. When Zachary ate his first bite of the magic hot dog, he started to see things.

First, there were ninja zebras going on all the playground rides. These zebras looked like horses with white and black stripes. They could turn some of their legs into arms and move their heads all the way around like an owl. The zebras held onto the swings with their front legs, which they used as arms, and pressed the buttons. They did ninja tricks to get off the swings, like cartwheels.

Zachary was having lots of fun in this underground school when he saw that the hot dog made anything he wanted come true. He wished for the floor of the underground world to become a little ocean, just one inch deep. The floor turned into ocean water with little waves, and there were little pirates on tiny ships sailing on the water. Everything Zachary imagined came true.

But then, Zachary remembered he had to go back to class soon. He told his friends he had to leave the secret underground playground and would come back another time. All the zebras and big kids said it was so much fun to play with Zachary. He went upstairs, found the bathroom, and then went back to class. He didn't tell anyone about the secret playground under his school. But every once in a while, Zachary would sneak there and have a little adventure. Zachary and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
