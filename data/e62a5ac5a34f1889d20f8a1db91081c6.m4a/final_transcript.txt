Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Emerson. Emerson loved going to the grocery store with her mom and dad to shop for food. One day, Emerson got to sit on top of the shopping cart while her dad pushed her through the aisles. Emerson saw donuts, cookies, chocolate, and even yogurt-covered raisins.

As Emerson looked around and enjoyed her ride, she spotted a rubber ducky on a shelf near some other toys. But this rubber ducky had real eyes! Most people couldn't see it because the rubber ducky's eyes were usually closed. But as Emerson's dad pushed the cart past the rubber ducky, Emerson saw it open its eyes and look at her.

So Emerson asked, "Dad, can we buy that rubber duck?" Her dad agreed since it was her birthday. They bought the rubber duck, lots of yummy candy, and a birthday cake before heading home.

At home, Emerson's dad put her in her car seat, and she buckled herself in. Her dad checked to make sure she was safe, and they drove home to their mom. When they arrived, their mom saw all the yummy food they bought, including the birthday cake, yogurt raisins, chocolate, strawberry-flavored ice cream, and grape juice.

Emerson's mom asked, "Emerson, are you sure you should eat all that?" Emerson said yes. Just then, she felt the rubber ducky in the grocery bag move a little. Emerson looked at the rubber ducky, and it stopped moving. She told her mom that she thought the rubber duck could come alive for a little bit, but her mom didn't think so.

Since it was her birthday, Emerson decided she wanted a special birthday bath with bubble bath and no shampoo. During a birthday bath, you get to splash so much that it makes a big mess on the floor. To clean up, you put two big towels on the floor to soak up all the water.

Emerson got in the bath with her rubber ducky. As the bathtub filled up, the rubber ducky opened its eyes again, and this time, Emerson's parents saw it too. Emerson said, "Look, Dad, I told you. Look, Mom, I told you. The rubber ducky is kind of alive because its eyes are open, and you see it."

Everyone was surprised when the duck opened its rubber mouth and said, "Quack, quack." Emerson's dad wondered how it could do that. It turned out that the bubble bath was magical! It was pink and made of sprinkles that turned into bubbles when they touched the water. There were also different colored sprinkles in the bubble bath.

Now that the ducky was alive, Emerson had lots of fun playing with it in the bath. After bath time, Emerson put on her pajamas, and they all decided to go outside for a pajama walk. A pajama walk is a walk kids can take with their parents after putting on their pajamas but before it gets too dark outside. If it's a little dark, kids can bring flashlights.

Emerson went outside with her mom and dad, and the ducky followed them. As it got darker, Emerson turned on her flashlight. The duck led them down a secret path with heart-shaped stones. When you stepped on these stones, they made little gold footprints shaped like your shoe.

Emerson and the ducky left gold footprints all along the heart-shaped trail. Emerson told her parents she had never seen this trail before. At the end of the trail, the duck stopped, and the tooth fairy appeared!

Emerson realized the tooth fairy was in town. The tooth fairy had a glittery magic wand, see-through butterfly wings, and was only as big as a thumb. The tooth fairy could fly!

The tooth fairy said to the duck, "Oh, is your name Ducky McDuke? I met you in a grocery store once. A girl's tooth fell out, and I was going to pick it up to give her a dollar under her pillow. But as I did that, I accidentally touched my magic wand on a rubber duck."

Emerson told her parents she figured out the mystery. The rubber duck had eyes that could open, could quack, and could swim and walk because the tooth fairy had touched it with her magic wand. Emerson said hello to the tooth fairy and asked if she would leave money under her pillow when her tooth fell out. The tooth fairy said yes.

Emerson told her parents it was time to go back from their pajama walk because it was getting dark. They went back home, kept the magical rubber ducky, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
