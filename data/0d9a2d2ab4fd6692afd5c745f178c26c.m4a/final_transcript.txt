Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a five-year-old girl named Prizelle. Sometimes before bedtime, Prizel's mom read her a book. There was a special book with lots of fairy pictures and twinkling stars called Foofu the Fairy from Fairyland. This book was very interesting because when her mom opened it, the first picture showed a regular girl with no fairy wings, dress, crown, or anything.

In the story, Foofu the Fairy lived in a special place where none of the fairies had wings. Foofu decided to make friends with some bees and went to a beehive. She told the bees she would help them collect nectar from flowers and turn it into honey using her fairy magic if they let her borrow some wings. One of the bees, Biggie Bee, said it would hurt them to take off their wings because they couldn't put them back on. Foofu explained there was a magic way to take wings off bees and put them on fairies without hurting them.

One of the bees agreed, and Foofu waved her wand in the beehive. Suddenly, the bee's wings floated off and went onto Foofu. The same thing happened with all the other fairies who lived with Foofu. They lined up outside the beehive, climbed up the tree one by one, and squeezed into the little beehive. After they got their wings, they started fluttering and floating in the air like butterflies.

They saw a magic tree that grew fairy dresses and crowns instead of leaves. The wind blew, and the dresses and crowns fell off the tree for the fairies to wear. Then, there was a whistling sound, and magic wands fell from the sky for all the fairies to pick up.

Priscell's mom read this book to her, but it never said what the fairies did after they got their wings, what they did with their magic wands, or how they gave the wings back to the bees. So Priscell asked her mom about it. Her mom said she would tell her the answer, but she had to keep it a secret.

Priscell's mom told her a story about when they went to an aquarium when Priscell was a toddler. At the aquarium, Priscell threw her toy boat into a big fish tank, and it turned into a real sailboat. A mermaid named Minnie Mermaid was crying on the boat because a shark was being mean to her and not sharing the toy boat. Priscell comforted the mermaid and shared a snack with her.

Suddenly, the fairies from the book flew through the windows of the aquarium, carrying the bees on their shoulders. They turned the sailboat back into a toy boat for Priscell to play with during bath time. Priscell asked the fairies how they traded wings with the bees, and they showed her how they used their magic wands to do it.

Priscell and her one-year-old brother Dylan lived happily ever after. The end. Tell all your friends to listen to this story because they'll like it.
