Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a girl named Evelyn. Evelyn lived in a special color city. In this colorful city, everyone got to paint their own houses. People painted their houses by splashing paint on the walls and then using their hands to mix and spread the paint into special designs. Some people liked to use red paint, while others preferred green paint.

But Evelyn's house was different. She lived in a rainbow house with so many different colors of paint. When Evelyn painted her house with her hands, her mama told her to wash her hands with soap afterward. Evelyn's house had a little river surrounding it, filled with green paint. There was a troll bridge to cross the river and reach the front door of her house. So, anyone who wanted to visit Evelyn's house had to walk over the troll bridge and get past the green paint river.

Inside Evelyn's house, there were trees, flowers, and even lots of birdies who went tweet, tweet, tweet. Evelyn loved her city because she got to ride a colorful bicycle. The streetlights in the evening and at nighttime had special colors too. Some were yellow, some were red, some were green, and some were blue.

The candy store in this city was the best because it had every color lollipop and even yellow chocolate. One day, Evelyn was walking around the city when she tripped on some licorice, a red candy. She fell down and scraped her knee. When it started to bleed, she began to cry.

Evelyn's mama quickly came to her and said she would be okay. She put a magical bandaid on the scrape called a poof bandaid. When you put the poof bandaid on a boo boo, the mama says, "poof," and the boo boo starts to feel better. Evelyn's mama said "poof" and suddenly, Evelyn felt better.

But something silly happened when her mama said "poof" – a unicorn appeared! The unicorn flew down from the sky, so white in the colorful city. Evelyn asked her mom if it was a real unicorn and why it came to the rainbow-colored city. Her mama explained that sometimes, when little kids get boo boos and receive poof bandaids, saying "poof" can make a unicorn appear.

The unicorn told Evelyn it had a special way of making boo boos better. Unicorns could make kids' boo boos feel better by licking them. So, the unicorn licked Evelyn's boo boo, and it felt all better. Evelyn and her family lived happily ever after in their colorful city. The end.
