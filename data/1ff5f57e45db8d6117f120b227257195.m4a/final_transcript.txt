Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Dax. It was Dax's birthday, and right in front of his house door, there was a big box wrapped in colorful paper with a ribbon. Dax opened the door, saw the gift, and excitedly brought it inside. He asked his mom and dad, "Can I open my birthday present?" His parents said yes.

Dax eagerly unwrapped the gift and used a butter knife to open the box. Inside, he found a glow-in-the-dark watch with a little dial on the side. He asked his parents if the watch would really glow green in the dark, and they said yes.

Dax turned off all the lights in the house, and his mom brought out a birthday cake with candles. In the dark, Dax's mom lit the candles and sang the "Happy Birthday" song. Dax noticed the candles' flames and his watch glowing on his wrist.

After blowing out the candles, the room was pitch black. Dax felt his watch moving on his wrist, and the watch's hands were spinning quickly. He realized that his birthday wish to go back in time to see dinosaurs had come true!

Suddenly, Dax's house disappeared, and they were outside with dinosaurs. Dax told his parents that his magic watch worked like a time machine. They saw furry dinosaurs that looked like kitty cat dinosaurs, some with wings and others shaped like snakes.

Dax also saw fish dinosaurs that could fly and breathe in both air and water. A little blue dinosaur that looked like a soccer ball with legs and a head approached Dax and his parents. It asked if they were dinosaurs too. Dax explained that they were people who traveled back in time with his magic watch.

The soccer ball dinosaur said it loved to eat grass, but there was none around. Dax thought his magic watch might be able to help. He turned the watch's green power on, spun the dial, and said, "Poof poof cadoof!" Suddenly, green grass started to grow.

The soccer ball dinosaur happily munched on the grass, which turned into white dandelions that tasted like ice cream. Dax explained that it was magic grass from his watch. The dinosaur thanked Dax for the tasty treat.

Dax's parents said it was getting late, and they should go back to their house in the future. Dax told them not to worry, and they held his hands as he used his magic watch to return to their home in Florida.

Back in their house, Dax told his parents that his magic glow-in-the-dark watch was the best birthday gift ever. All the neighborhood kids wanted to see his special watch, and Dax and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
