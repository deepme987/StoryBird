Once upon a time, Nina was walking around town with her dad, Paul. Nina's dad pointed to the sky and said, "Look at that cloud over there!" The cloud was not white or gray, but pink, and it was getting lower and lower, heading towards the forest near Nina and Malcolm's house.

Nina told her dad that they should follow the pink cloud because it looked like cotton candy. So Nina, her dad, and her brother Malcolm went to the forest where the pink cloud fell. When they got there, they saw some magical things. First, there was a waterfall, but the water flowed from the bottom to the top instead of falling down. Next to the waterfall, there were horses with fireworks on their backs, making beautiful colors in the sky.

Nina said, "Wow, this is a magical pink cloud! I've never seen an upside-down waterfall or fireworks coming from horses." She suggested they keep exploring the forest. Just then, she spotted a princess castle hidden behind some trees and bushes. The pink cloud made the castle look foggy and mysterious.

Nina, Malcolm, and their dad decided to go inside the castle. They knocked on the big wooden door, and it opened all by itself. As they walked around the castle, they saw floating princess dresses. Nina and Malcolm followed the dresses and found an escalator. They couldn't see where it led, but their dad agreed they should go on it because Malcolm loved escalators.

The escalator took them higher and higher until they reached outer space! At the end of the escalator, they found astronaut suits. Nina put on a princess dress and an astronaut suit, while her dad and Malcolm put on regular and prince astronaut suits, respectively.

As they floated in space, they discovered a new planet made of a giant apple behind the moon. Nina's dad explained that a huge apple tree from the time of the dinosaurs must have grown all the way to outer space, and the apple had fallen off and become a planet.

Nina, Malcolm, and their dad floated to the apple planet, where they saw a sign that said, "Kids who visit the apple planet become princes and princesses forever." They decided to stay and found many real princes and princesses dancing and listening to music.

Behind the apple planet, they saw a space rainbow that led to the king of all unicorns. The unicorn king offered to take them on a trip through space, visiting different stars at super-fast speeds. They had a great time zipping around with the unicorn king, but eventually, he had to take them back to the escalator.

Nina, Malcolm, and their dad went back down the escalator to the princess castle. When they reached the bottom, they saw that the sun was setting, and it was time to go home for dinner. They said goodbye to the castle and went back to their house for a yummy meal. Nina, Malcolm, and their dad lived happily ever after. The end.
