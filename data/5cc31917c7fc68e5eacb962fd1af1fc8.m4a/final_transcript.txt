Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Avery. One day, Avery was walking around the streets of Manhattan with her dad. As they walked, Avery spotted a pair of pink glasses with stars on them lying next to a tree. Nobody was around, so Avery asked her dad if she could pick up the glasses. Her dad said it was okay, so Avery picked up the magical pink glasses.

When Avery put the glasses in front of her eyes, she gained magic powers! All she had to do was look at something with her pink glasses, and she could turn into that thing. So, she looked at her dad and turned into him! Her dad was surprised and asked if he had a twin. Avery explained that it was her, just looking like a grown-up man. Her dad told her to look in a window to see her reflection and turn back into herself. And it worked!

Avery was so excited about her magic glasses that she suggested going on an adventure. She asked her dad if they could visit her grandparents by airplane. Her dad wondered how they would do that, but Avery had an idea. She would use her magic glasses to turn into an airplane, and her parents could ride inside her. Her dad agreed, and Avery turned into an airplane.

Avery, now an airplane, flew her parents to her grandparents' house. Along the way, she remembered seeing a real fairy with pixie dust when she was younger. So, she tried to imagine a fairy while flying, and a real fairy appeared inside the airplane! The fairy asked where they were going, and Avery's parents told her about their visit to the grandparents. The fairy offered to show them some cool tricks.

As they continued flying, the airplane suddenly ran out of fuel. But the fairy saved the day by putting pixie dust in the airplane's engines, making it fly without fuel! Soon, they arrived at the grandparents' city, and Avery carefully landed the airplane. She turned back into herself, and they all walked through the airport with the fairy.

Outside the airport, they saw a big dragon called a kazoo dragon. It could breathe water and turn it into fire! The kazoo dragon smiled at Avery, maybe because of her magical pink glasses. The dragon offered to give them a ride, but the fairy was scared. Avery told the dragon to be nice, and the dragon gave the fairy a lollipop.

The kazoo dragon explained that it knew Avery's grandparents and had an important job. It helped put out forest fires by spraying water on them. The friendly dragon took Avery, the fairy, and her parents to her grandparents' house. They all got to see the grandparents, and Avery and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
