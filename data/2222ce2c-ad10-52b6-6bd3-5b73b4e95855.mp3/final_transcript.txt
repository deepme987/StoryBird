Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big girl named Lucy. One morning, Lucy woke up to a special surprise from her dad. Usually, she had eggs for breakfast, but today there were waffles and pancakes with maple syrup. Lucy was really happy, so she got dressed and went downstairs. Her mom and dad were making the yummiest waffles and pancakes, shaped like Mickey Mouse, the letter L for Lucy, and even a kitty cat.

When the pancakes were ready, Lucy sat down to eat. She started with the L pancake, pouring maple syrup on it. It was very yummy, but she wanted more. So, she told her parents she wanted to eat the kitty cat pancake, and they agreed. As Lucy ate the kitty cat pancake, she felt something funny happening near her tushy. She was growing a kitty cat tail! Lucy thought this was interesting because she always wanted to be like a kitty cat for Halloween or dress-up. As she kept eating, her ears, arms, and legs turned into kitty cat ears, arms, and legs. Soon, Lucy became a cat.

Lucy's parents were so surprised to see their daughter as a big, furry, talking cat named Lucy with a white L on its head. Lucy told them the maple syrup must have been special. Her mom remembered buying it from a unique store with teeth and other odd things. She thought maybe the tooth fairy accidentally left some magic dust in the maple syrup.

Lucy enjoyed being a kitty cat but wanted to make sure she could turn back into a person. She asked her parents to make a person-shaped pancake before they ran out of the special maple syrup. Lucy's parents agreed, and Lucy started crawling around the house like a kitty cat.

Outside, all the kids wanted to play with Lucy because she was soft, furry, and cute. One kid asked if Lucy could be their pet, but Lucy said she couldn't because she already had a home and didn't want to be a kitty cat forever. The kids understood but still wanted to play with her. One of them gave Lucy some kitty kibbles, which smelled like lollipops to her now. As she ate them, she saw a mouse in the grass.

Usually, Lucy was afraid of mice, but now she wanted to catch it. Her parents told her not to eat the mouse, but it was too late. Lucy caught the mouse, and it begged her not to eat it. The mouse told Lucy it used to be a person too, but after eating a mouse-shaped waffle, it turned into a mouse and didn't know how to change back. Lucy promised not to eat the mouse and took it back to her parents.

At Lucy's house, they also found a talking ant. The ant said it lived in a different house in Boonton, New Jersey, and turned into an ant after eating an ant-shaped pancake. Lucy told her parents, and her mom thought it must have been the special maple syrup. Lucy invited the mouse and the ant inside her house.

Lucy had a plan. She asked her mom to make person-shaped pancakes for everyone. As they ate the pancakes, Lucy turned back into a person, the mouse turned back into her friend from school, and the ant turned into her grandma. Lucy realized her mom and grandma had gone shopping together for the special maple syrup.

Lucy was happy to be a person again, and that the mouse and ant were back to normal. She suggested they have a party to celebrate but save some special maple syrup for future adventures. They had a little party, and Lucy and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
