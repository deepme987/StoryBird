Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four-year-old boy named Kaden. Kaden lived next to a big forest with many trees, deer, mountain lions, bunny rabbits, and coyotes. Kaden never went into the forest alone; he always went with his mom, dad, a teacher, or some friends.

One day, close to Halloween, Kaden was walking in the forest with his mom, wearing a special monster truck costume. While walking, Kaden saw a spooky tree with an owl on a branch. The owl had yellow eyes and looked at Kaden. He told his mom about the owl, but she couldn't see it. Kaden insisted, "Mom, you have to believe me. I really did see an owl on the tree." Kaden looked up again, and the owl was still there. His mom still couldn't see it, but sometimes kids can see things that grownups can't.

Kaden looked more closely at the tree and saw leaves made of cotton candy next to the owl. He thought maybe the owl wanted to share or eat the cotton candy. On the other side of the tree, Kaden saw branches made of candy cane with cotton candy leaves. At the very top of the tree was a lollipop, and instead of bark, the tree had gummy bears. It was the yummiest, sugariest tree, and a little spooky with Halloween decorations like a pretend spider.

Kaden told his mom to look again, saying, "Look, there's so much candy!" But his mom thought it was just a regular tree. Kaden insisted, "No, mom, really. It has so much candy. It has cotton candy, candy cane branches, a lollipop on top, and I think the owl is in charge of the candy." Just then, the tree started dropping candy, and the wind blew it all over the ground, making a big mess.

Finally, Kaden's mom saw the candy and agreed with Kaden. They knew they had to clean up the candy because too much candy could give the forest animals tummy aches. But they didn't have a broom or anything to clean up with, so they had to think of another way.

Kaden found magic glasses under some candy on the ground. When he put them on, he could make bugs appear just by thinking of them. Bugs love to eat sugar, so Kaden thought of roly polys, caterpillars, worms, ladybugs, grasshoppers, and friendly bees that wouldn't sting people. He gathered all the bugs and told them their job was to eat the candy and save some for him and his friends.

The bugs happily ate the candy, and Kaden and his mom found an empty bag to save some candy for themselves and their friends. They went home with their bag of candy, shared it with their friends, and everyone was happy. Kaden and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
