Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four and a half-year-old named Leopold. Leopold was almost five years old, but not many other kids knew that his birthday was coming up. Leopold's mama had a special plan for his birthday. When Leopold woke up that day, she was going to make him yummy pancakes with maple syrup. After breakfast, Leopold planned to go on a hot air balloon adventure. A hot air balloon is a huge balloon, even bigger than a house, with a big basket underneath for people to stand in. When the hot air balloon is filled with hot air, it goes up into the sky, and it feels like you're flying even though you don't have wings.

On Leopold's birthday, he and his mom went to a big soccer field where they found a hot air balloon. Leopold, his mom, and some other kids, including a girl named Leila, climbed into the basket. The captain of the hot air balloon told Leopold that since it was his fifth birthday, he could wear a captain's hat and help give instructions. Leopold told the captain they were ready to go, so the captain turned on the fire, and the hot air balloon started to rise. As they went up, Leopold waved to all the kids and pets on the soccer field below.

As they got higher into the sky, they passed some colorful parrots. Parrots can sometimes talk, and as they flew by the hot air balloon, they said "hot air balloon" in their parrot way. Leopold was having so much fun, and the captain told him it was time to steer. Leopold turned the steering wheel, and they flew into an orange-colored sky, which was very pretty and different from the usual blue sky.

Leopold steered the hot air balloon over a desert filled with sand and very little water. He told the captain they were ready to land for an adventure. The captain told Leopold to press the down button, and they landed very gently on the desert ground. Everyone clapped because Leopold did a great job landing the balloon.

When they got out of the hot air balloon, Leopold, his mom, and Leila saw a blue chameleon on top of a cactus. The chameleon said it was the king of the desert and asked if they had permission to be in its kingdom. Leopold explained that they were just there for his birthday and didn't know about the chameleon king. The chameleon asked if they brought any treasure, but Leopold's mom checked the hot air balloon and found none. The chameleon then asked how long they planned to stay in the desert. Leopold asked if the chameleon could change colors, and suddenly it turned green and blended in with the cactus.

Just then, they saw a tiny elephant, as small as a spider, with as many legs as a spider too. The little elephant climbed up the cactus carrying something. The chameleon asked what it was carrying, and the elephant said it was the chameleon's crown. The chameleon thanked the elephant and told Leopold and Leila that since it was Leopold's birthday, they could have some cake and play in the desert as long as they wanted. The chameleon showed them a secret compartment with the yummiest cake ever and five candles on top. Everyone, including the tiny elephant and the chameleon, sang happy birthday to Leopold. They all enjoyed the cake and played in the desert, and Leopold and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
