Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a princess named Milla. Milla lived in a crayon world where all the buildings, castles, and houses were colored with crayon on the outside. The roofs were all different colors, and grownups could even use crayons to make rainbows on them. The sidewalks in the whole city had lots of different chalk patterns, and the streets had hopscotch patterns. Some of the cars were silly because they could jump up and down, and there was a special hopscotch for cars where different wheels would bounce back and forth.

In the land where Milla lived, she was a princess, and her parents were the King and the Queen. One day, Milla saw a stone bridge growing outside her garden, where there were many colorful flowers. The stone bridge led all the way to a rainbow in the sky. Milla showed her parents the magical stone bridge, and they decided to walk on it together.

Milla and her parents held hands and walked on the stone bridge through the sky, past some clouds, until they reached the rainbow. When they were safely on the rainbow, they looked around and saw a genie taking a bath and splashing in the clouds on one side, and a silly balloon giraffe floating in the sky on the other side. Milla thought a child from the ground must have let the balloon giraffe go a long time ago.

Milla and her parents walked on the rainbow until they saw a sign pointing to the right that said "Ice Cream Land." They thought it would be a great idea to visit Ice Cream Land, where the best ice cream makers in the world competed once a year to see who could make the yummiest ice cream. All the children who lived in Ice Cream Land got to judge and choose their favorite ice cream.

The ice cream makers came from far and wide with different kinds of ice cream, like strawberry, vanilla, watermelon, cantaloupe, plum, sugar, custard, and cupcake ice cream. There was even an old ice cream maker with a cane who had lollipop ice cream that turned kids' eyes red when they ate it. The children loved this ice cream for playing party tricks on their friends.

When Milla arrived in Ice Cream Land, holding her parents' hands, all the children saw that she was a princess. Two monkeys rolled out a red carpet for Milla and her parents, the King and Queen, to enter Ice Cream Land. They walked down the red carpet, waving at all the children who watched them as they walked to the center of Ice Cream Town.

In the center of Ice Cream Town, there was a fountain that shot out milkshakes instead of water, with sprinkles on top. There were also special fountains that made sprinkles come out, and sugar cubes floated in the rivers.

Milla went to the center of Ice Cream Town, where all the ice cream store owners from around the world were gathered for the final competition. The head ice cream maker asked Milla to try a unicorn-shaped ice cream with sprinkles, whipped cream, chocolate, and caramel. It smelled more like a freshly baked cupcake than ice cream. Milla told the head ice cream maker that she didn't like one of the ingredients, so he clapped his hands, and the ice cream turned into rainbow sprinkle ice cream.

All the children cheered, and Milla tasted the rainbow sprinkle ice cream. She decided it was the yummiest ice cream ever and gave the ice cream maker a Golden Star award. Everyone was so happy that they clapped for Milla and her family.

As Milla and her family walked around, they saw that there were not only people in Ice Cream Land but also kitty cats who liked ice cream. Some of the cats were assistants who helped the ice cream makers and even tasted the ice cream to see how yummy it was.

Milla saw a ginger cat, a light orange-red color, eating some of the rainbow sprinkle ice cream. When the cat ate the ice cream, its eyes turned into people eyes. When Milla ate her rainbow sprinkle ice cream, she gained kitty powers too. Milla and the ginger cat learned how to talk in meows that they could understand. The ginger cat wanted to be Milla's pet forever, so she took it back to her castle, across the rainbow, after the bridge that went into the sky, back to the crayon land. Milla and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
