Hi, my name is Rihanna, and Makeup Choice is the best podcast ever. Hi, my name is RyanA and I'm four years old and and I live in Pakistan and my birthday is April 14. And I would like a story about a unicorn, a flower and a dime swipe. Tonight's makeup story is a request from a girl named Liana who lives in Pakistan and who is four years old. And Liana also has a little sister whose name is Reya. And Liana asked for us to make up a story that includes a unicorn, a flower and a dinosaur. Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a big girl whose name was Liana. Liana had a princess dress. And the princess dress that Liana had magical kinds of powers because whenever Liana put on her princess dress, she could feel her toes start to twinkle a little bit. And when Liana had her princess dress on, if she stepped on the floor with her tippy toes, then she could start to float in the air a little bit. And Liana had a trick that she used to do with her princess dress where she would start walking on her tippy toes and then suddenly she would be able to fly a little bit. One day, Liana was walking in the air. And as Liana was walking in the air, she saw that there was an airplane outside. And the airplane was not so big. And it looked like it wasn't the kind of airplane that might have people. It looked like the kind of airplane that might have fairies. The airplane was big and pink, and instead of having two wings, the airplane had six different wings. And the airplane's wings would flap up and down just like a butterfly. And the airplane also had a helicopter rotor, the turny thing on top. The airplane was also really silly because it had a kite that was attached to it. And the kite showed a picture of a princess castle. And wherever the airplane would go, it would pull the princess castle kite on a string and it would fly all over. Wellana was looking up from outside her house as she was floating on top of the grass and she saw that that special kind of airplane with all of the wings and with the helicopter rotor on top and with the kite that looked like a princess castle was right next to her. And Liana decided to float right up to the airplane. And she floated to the airplane, and she looked inside of the airplane's windows. When Liana looked inside the airplane's windows, she saw that the airplane was full of flowers. She had never seen an airplane that had so many flowers. It was the most colorful airplane in the whole world. There were tulips, there were roses, there were dandelions. And there were all kinds of flowers that kids could pick and cut and play with. And they would grow right back after you picked it off. So it was the kind of flower that grew on airplanes that if you picked it off, it just grew right back. And if there was a dandelion and a kid picked up the dandelion and started blowing the dandelion, then it would just grow right back so a kid could do it again. Well, Liana knocked on the door of the wind on the door of the plane, and the pilot saw her through the window. And the pilot was a unicorn. And the unicorn was giving an airplane ride to a bunch of fairies who lived on the moon and were trying to go down for a fairy party, which was in a cave in the mountains of Pakistan. Now, the fairies were going from so far away because they lived all the way in the moon, and they had to travel a long trip through outer space to get to the atmosphere, and then they had to descend through the clouds, and they were now close to Earth. And so they were very happy that the unicorn pilot found a floating princess. And they didn't know that Liana wasn't a real princess because Liana had a princess dress on and she was next to the fairy plain, and she looked like a real princess because she could float. And so all of the fairies that were inside of the fairy plane started tapping on their windows and saying and Liana was, yeah. Bud is it the kind of fairy like fairies that can fly, or is it the fairy boat? It's fairies that can fly. Bud there were so many fairies that could fly that were on this there's so many fairies that could fly that were on this airplane. Normally you might ask, why didn't the fairies just fly there by themselves from the moon? But that's too far for a ferry to fly because a ferry would get tired if it flew so far. So that's why the ferries were taking the special airplane that was driven by the unicorn. Well, the pilot of the airplane, who was a unicorn, told Liana that she could go into the airplane because there was a secret tunnel in the front of the airplane where you could kind of open up a secret hatch and then get into the airplane. It was like a straw. And you'd get sucked in through the straw, into the airplane, through some flowers, all the way to the part where the fairies were. And Liana got inside of the airplane, and she saw that all of the fairies had fairy wings and were so excited to be back on Earth. And some of the fairies were carrying around flowers, and some of the fairies had stickers that they were playing with, and some of the fairies had magnet tiles, and they liked to build things and then go in and out. There were even two fairies that had race cars, and they kept saying, My race car is faster. And then the other ferry would fly with her race car and say, no, mine is. And then they would laugh because they thought it was so silly. And Liana didn't realize how fast a race car could go on a plane because then it's like the race car speed plus the plane speed. And the ferries also helped push it with some ferry dust in the background. So it was almost the race cars on that kind of ferry airplane were basically as fast as rocket ships, the fastest kind of race cars in the whole world. Also, on the floor of the airplane, they had that kind of thing that's kind of like a treadmill or in an airport when you walk on those conveyor belts. And so the race cars went even faster and it was the fastest kind of place. Well, yeah, bud, so maybe if a ferry had a whole wing, it could still get where it needed. Yeah. And so ferries were able to get where they needed really quickly using this. But the airplane was still flying because there was going to be a big ferry party in a cave in Pakistan. And so the unicorn pilot said, we're approaching the ground for landing. And Liana put on her seatbelt in the airplane and the unicorn pilot said, we see the airport coming up. And Liana saw that there was an airport. And the airport had so many twinkly lights right next to it, and the runway was made of diamonds. And right next to the airport there was a big castle that had lots of different flags and there was a cookie factory that was inside of the airport. And finally the unicorn pilot said, and we touched down and the ferry airplane landed on the runway. Soon the ferry airplane came to a complete stop. The unicorn pilot told all of the fairies and Liana that they could take off their seatbelts. They took off their seatbelts and they went out through a special secret tunnel that went out of the airplane under the ground to the cave where the fairy party was. Now when they got to the cave with the fairy party, everything looked like it was the color of sugar or salt. It was all white. And instead of having regular rocks in the cave, all of the rocks in the cave looked like rubies and gems. And they were so colorful, and you could take pieces of them to make necklaces. And in the cave, there were little dinosaurs. Most of the big dinosaurs died a long, long time ago and that's why we can't see them if we walk around the earth. But there were a couple of baby dinosaurs, little itty bitty ones that were the size of mice that did survive and that hid out in this secret cave in Pakistan. And Liana and the fairies got to have a party with the little dinosaurs. And the little dinosaurs said that they were also secret princes and princesses of dinosaur land. And they had such a good party until Liana said that she had to go back home to the rest of her family and also to help babysit her little sister Reya and the fairies and the dinosaur and the unicorn. Pilot said goodbye to Liana and Liana lived happily ever after with her family. The end.
