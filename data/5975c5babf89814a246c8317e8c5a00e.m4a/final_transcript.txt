Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a five-year-old named Jonah. Jonah lived underground in a tunnel with lots of squirrels and rabbits. He loved to play with them and sometimes followed them up their holes to see if there were any kitty cats or coyotes outside. If there were none, Jonah would go out and walk around the grass.

One day, Jonah saw a magical spider while walking on the grass. The spider was rainbow-colored and very fuzzy. It had a silly duck-like mouth and said, "quack, quack." The spider was big and friendly, and it held an umbrella because it didn't like the rain. Jonah watched as the spider spun a round web around the bushes, quacking as it worked.

This was no ordinary spider web; it was a magical one! It had colorful sparks coming out of it, and if you listened closely, it made a sound. Jonah realized it was a trampoline made of spider web! The magical spider could make bouncy, jumpy webs just like a trampoline.

The spider invited Jonah and the nearby rabbits to jump on the bouncy trampoline. They had never been on a bouncy spider web before, so they asked, "Will we get stuck?" The friendly, colorful magic spider holding the umbrella said, "No, it's just a bouncy trampoline." Jonah and the rabbits started jumping on the trampoline, having lots of fun. No bugs got stuck on this web; it was just for playing.

As they were jumping, they heard a noise in the distance and saw a dragon. But it wasn't a big, scary dragon; it was medium-sized, like a kitty cat or a bunny rabbit, and looked like a fluffy stuffed animal. This dragon didn't breathe fire; it couldn't even open its mouth.

The dragon asked if it could join Jonah and the rabbits on the trampoline. They agreed, and the dragon started jumping with them. It jumped so high that it reached the moon! The dragon flapped its wings and carried Jonah up to the clouds. There, they found ducks living on the clouds because ducks like water, and clouds are made of water.

The ducks asked Jonah what he was doing, and he told them about the trampoline party. The dragon invited the ducks to join, and they flew down to the spider web. When they arrived, they saw the rainbow-colored, fuzzy spider with its umbrella.

The ducks asked the spider why it had a beak and quacked like a duck. The spider and the duck talked to each other, and the duck told the spider it lived in the clouds. The spider said it wanted to live on a cloud too, but the duck couldn't carry it up there. The dragon offered to help, as ducks aren't good at carrying things with their webbed feet.

So, the dragon carried the spider up to the clouds. The spider started spinning its magic web around the clouds, turning them different colors. The sky was filled with beautiful, colorful clouds, all thanks to the special spider.

Children all over the world looked up at the colorful clouds and marveled at their beauty. The clouds were made of the same bouncy spider web as the trampoline, so if you threw a ball at them, it would bounce off! People invented a game where they used slingshots to shoot balls at the colorful clouds, making them bounce around.

This game only happened because Jonah found the magical spider web. He eventually moved out of the underground tunnel and into a regular house, where he went to preschool and kindergarten. His friends were so happy that he discovered a way to make the clouds different colors. Jonah and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
