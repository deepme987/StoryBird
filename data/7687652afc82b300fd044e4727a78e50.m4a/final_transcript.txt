Once upon a time, a long time ago, Colette told her mom that she wanted to visit the toothpaste factory to see where kids' toothpaste comes from. Kids always see toothpaste in the bathroom, and they know that their parents buy it from stores. But most kids have never been to a toothpaste factory. So, Colette sat in her car seat, and her mom and dad drove her to the biggest toothpaste factory in the world. This factory was built inside a mountain, with a big door at the front. Colette got out of her car seat, and her dad knocked on the toothpaste factory door, saying, "Knock, knock, knock." Suddenly, the door opened up by itself.

Inside the door, there was a big sea, a huge ocean made of toothpaste. This ocean was hidden under the mountain, and usually, people couldn't see it. The factory workers scooped up little buckets of toothpaste and poured them into toothpaste bottles. Colette saw the vast sea full of toothpaste, with boats floating on it. Some boats were made of Lego, but there was one wooden boat with a pirate flag on it.

On the toothpaste sea, there was a pirate ship full of lady pirates. They wore eye patches and had pretend swords that were actually magical. When they waved their swords in the air, they could get any toy they wanted. The lady pirates walked around the wooden ship, waving their magic swords and making lots of toys appear. One of the lady pirates said, "Hey!" and waved her sword, making a real alligator appear.

The alligator swam through the toothpaste ocean when its mama came up to it. The alligator's mom said, "It's time for us to brush your alligator teeth with this toothpaste, and then we will go to sleep." There was so much toothpaste that they could use as much as they wanted. The alligator mama didn't even need a toothbrush; she used her alligator hands to brush the toothpaste from the sea onto her baby alligator.

The lady pirate called out to Colette, "Colette, do you want to come on the sea of toothpaste and ride in our pirate ship?" Colette asked her dad if they should go, and he agreed. But the pirate ship was too far away, so they needed a ride from a friendly parrot. A giant, colorful parrot swooped down from the top of the mountain and offered them a ride on its enormous wings. Colette and her dad climbed onto the parrot, but first, they had to put a car seat on it. The parrot flew them over the alligator and all the way to the pirate ship full of lady pirates.

When they reached the pirate ship, one of the lady pirates asked Colette, "What do you think is under the water of this toothpaste sea?" Colette replied, "I think there is something magical there." The pirate waved her sword, and mermaids appeared! It turns out that mermaids live in the toothpaste sea under the mountain. They can jump up and down, and sometimes, unicorns give them rides.

Colette had lots of fun riding a unicorn, but she wanted to go to outer space. She asked the lady pirate if they could make the toothpaste sea go to outer space. The lady pirate agreed, and all the lights inside the mountain turned off. They could see many stars, a little moon, and even some planets. Colette had a blast steering the pirate ship through space on top of the toothpaste ocean.

Before leaving, Colette asked the lady pirate if she could bring some toothpaste home. The lady pirate gave Colette and her dad some sugar toothpaste, but her dad said, "No, no, we don't want sugar toothpaste." However, when they got back home, they discovered that the lady pirate had given them cake frosting instead of toothpaste. So, the lady pirate sent another piece of toothpaste with the parrot, who flew it all the way back to Colette's house. Colette and her parents lived happily ever after. The end.
