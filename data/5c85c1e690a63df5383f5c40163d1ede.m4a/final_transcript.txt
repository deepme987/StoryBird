Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a princess named Pearl. Pearl was four years old, with blonde hair, and she lived in a house that floated in the air. The house had big butterfly wings and could float by flapping the wings. Pearl and her parents could steer the house wherever they wanted because there was a big steering wheel in the living room. The house also had a big red slide at the bottom for when they wanted to go down to the ground. Sometimes, Pearl would slide down and reach the top of a tree, then climb down carefully with ropes and a helmet.

One day, Pearl was floating in her house with her family and her dog, Penny. Suddenly, it got dark outside, and they saw many twinkling, bright, shiny stars in the sky. The stars fell from the sky towards the Earth and turned into fairies that looked like fireflies. The fairies made the sky sparkle, and it looked very special. Soon, all the stars had turned into fairies and fireflies, surrounding Pearl's floating house.

The fairies formed the shape of a mermaid, and a real mermaid appeared, flying through the sky next to Pearl's house. The mermaid, named Minnie, sang and floated alongside the house. Minnie knocked on the door and asked if she could come in. Pearl said yes and asked how Minnie could float in the air since mermaids usually stay in the water. Minnie explained that she came from a special family of mermaids that could also float. Pearl invited Minnie to go down the slide with her, and Minnie agreed.

Minnie the Mermaid and Pearl went down the slide and landed in a pool. Pearl had never swum with a mermaid before and was surprised when Penny, her dog, followed them into the pool. They all swam together, playing special mermaid and doggy games.

As they played, the fairies followed them to the pool, wanting to share a secret with Pearl. The fairies told her about a special mountain made of cake on the other side of the mountain. Pearl thought it was a great idea, so she climbed up a ladder, helping Minnie and Penny back into the floating house. They steered the house to the mountain made of cake and had lots of fun there.

They played a game where they jumped on the cake, which turned into a merry-go-round, spinning in circles. Minnie the Mermaid loved this game the most. Suddenly, a candle appeared in the middle of the cake, and they saw a big giant. The giant said, "I thought it was my birthday. I was going to blow out this birthday cake for me." They told the giant, "Silly giant, this is not a giant's birthday cake. This is a regular merry-go-round birthday cake for big girls, fairies, and mermaids, but not for giants to eat." The giant apologized and went away.

Pearl ate some of the cake and shared it with Penny and the fairies. Then, she went back to the house and told her mama about the big adventure. Pearl and her mama lived happily ever after. The end.
