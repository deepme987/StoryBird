Once upon a time, long ago, there was a big boy named Carter. Carter wanted to teach his little two-year-old brother, Colton, how to do magic. Carter had a special idea for doing magic. He told his mom that since his birthday was coming up, they should make a magic birthday cake. Carter's mom asked, "Are you sure you don't want us to just buy a regular cake from the store? Then you'll get a piece of the regular cake." But Carter said, "No, mom, I'm about to turn five years old on January 8th. I want to make a magic cake."

Carter's mom asked, "Well, what should we put in the magic cake?" Carter told her they needed sprinkles, sugar, cake mix, and food coloring. They also needed a unicorn horn to make it more magical. So Carter and Colton went on a hunt for a unicorn horn.

Do you know what happened? They were walking around in their backyard, and Carter and Colton decided to dig. They didn't find any unicorn horns, but they found some reindeer horns attached to a tree branch! Maybe Santa had been nearby with his magical reindeer.

Carter thought that the reindeer horns could be magical too. So he asked his mom for a shoulder ride to reach the horns. But even on his mom's shoulders, Carter wasn't tall enough. So they had an idea: Colton would climb on top of Carter, who was on his mom's shoulders. With their dad's help, they tried again, but they still couldn't reach.

Carter told his dad to get a broom. His dad brought a broom from the kitchen, and Colton used it to knock down the reindeer horns. Everyone cheered because now they had the magical reindeer horns to mix into the cake.

As they went inside, Carter noticed that part of the reindeer horn looked like a candy cane. He asked his mom to taste it, and it tasted just like a candy cane! They decided to mix the cake with the reindeer horn.

As they mixed the cake, it started to get bigger and bigger. It grew so big that they had to mix it in the bathtub! When it was time to bake the cake, it wouldn't fit in the oven. So they made a campfire in their backyard and cooked the cake over it.

The cake kept getting bigger and bigger until it was as big as their house! Suddenly, the cake exploded and splattered everywhere. Little cupcakes came out of the cake, and all the kids in the neighborhood came running to eat them. The cupcakes tasted like candy canes, and everyone was so happy.

Then, parts of the cake that splattered began to float in the air and turned into cake balls. There were 3,000 million cake balls floating all over the world! The cake balls went to all the kids' houses, making everyone happy.

Carter got the biggest piece of all and shared it with Colton and their parents. All the kids in the world said, "Happy birthday, Carter!" Carter became the best kid in the whole world who got to give cake to everyone else. Carter, Colton, and their whole family lived happily ever after. The end.
