Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Troy. Troy was the best at playing hide and seek. He knew many special ways to hide that made it hard for others to find him. One of Troy's tricks was to tell his mom and dad to close their eyes, look the other way, and cover their eyes. Then, he would ask them to count all the way up to 20. While they were counting, Troy would quickly put on a ninja costume and hide in great spots, like in the closet or inside a box. When he wore his ninja costume, the grownups usually had to give up. Troy's mom would say, "Troy, you win. Where are you?" Troy would laugh and show them his hiding spot, and they couldn't believe he hid there.

One day, Troy decided to play hide and seek with his parents. He put on his special ninja costume and hid behind the curtains, where his clothes matched the color. As Troy hid, he saw another ninja named Lloyd. Lloyd was a captain ninja, which meant he had special powers. Regular ninjas were good at hiding, going fast, and doing cool tricks like cartwheels and acrobatics. But captain ninjas, like Lloyd, could do power tricks. They could change the color of their costume to blend in, just like a chameleon. Captain ninjas were also great at jumping. They had buttons on their shoes that made them jump as high as a house!

Troy was excited to meet Lloyd, the first captain ninja he had ever met. He told Lloyd he was hiding from his parents and soon they would call out, "Troy, where are you?" Troy suggested that Lloyd could pretend to be him since he was good at changing his appearance. Lloyd agreed and changed his face to look like Troy's. When Troy's parents came into the room, Lloyd jumped out and said, "I'm here. I'm here." Troy's parents asked if it was really him, and Lloyd, pretending to be Troy, said yes. Troy's mom mentioned she had a treat for him, and the real Troy came out from behind the curtains, asking about the treat. His mom said it was a marshmallow from a marshmallow tree that a magician had planted in their chimney.

Troy's mom saw two Troys and asked which one was real. Lloyd said he was, but the real Troy disagreed. Troy's mom decided to ask a question to find out the truth. She asked, "What kind of animal can make ketchup come out of its mouth?" Lloyd, still pretending to be Troy, said, "A duck." But the real Troy knew the answer was a friendly dragon. Troy's mom realized who the real Troy was and asked about the ninja. Lloyd explained they were playing together, and he used his chameleon camouflage to look like Troy. Troy's mom laughed and said it was silly.

She told Troy and Lloyd they could play with Nerf guns outside. Nerf guns are toys that shoot soft, pretend bullets that don't hurt. Ninjas are great at playing with Nerf guns because they can move fast and jump high. Lloyd had a cool trick where whipped cream came out behind the Nerf bullet, leaving a trail. Troy would duck to avoid the bullet but eat the whipped cream in the air. Troy and his family had so much fun playing with Lloyd the ninja, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
