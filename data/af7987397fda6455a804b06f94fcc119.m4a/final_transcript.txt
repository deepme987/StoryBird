Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named Dean. It was getting close to nighttime, and Dean knew that there would be fireworks that night. There was a big parade in town, and there would be cotton candy, hot dogs, and kids could stay up late. That night, there would be a big fireworks show with colorful designs in the dark sky. Dean was very excited, so he told his mom they should wear pajamas since they would be out late. Dean put on his pajamas and went out with his mom and dad in the city of Los Angeles.

They arrived at the beach where the fireworks would be. The sandy beach had red water instead of its usual blue. Dean saw a man with a tall blue hat with stars on it, a silly carrot-shaped nose, and a blue robe with stars. He had a magic wand and a long beard. Dean thought the man might be a wizard who turned the ocean red. His mom said there are no real wizards, but to find out, you must whisper a secret question to them. If they answer correctly, they are a real wizard.

Dean remembered the secret question from a dream. When the wizard came close, Dean whispered, "Huang Ha." The wizard looked around and then said, "Huang Hala." Dean knew he was a real wizard. He told his parents it would be a special fireworks show.

The wizard pointed his wand at the fireworks on the beach and said, "Firefly." The first firework went off with a kaboom and shot colorful lines into the sky. These fireworks went higher and higher instead of falling down. The next firework had fireflies in it, creating a beautiful design of the American flag. The fireflies danced and pretended to be birds.

Dean told the wizard he had an idea. He suggested making a firework with a dragon coming out of it. The wizard agreed, and the next firework exploded into a magical cloud. The cloud changed colors and turned into a friendly fire-breathing dragon. The dragon flew down to the parade and toasted marshmallows for the kids to make s'mores.

Dean told everyone about the wizard, and all the kids wanted to see him. The wizard raised his arms, put his wand in his mouth, and jumped up. He turned into an octopus with helicopter rotors and flew away into the night sky.

Dean and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
