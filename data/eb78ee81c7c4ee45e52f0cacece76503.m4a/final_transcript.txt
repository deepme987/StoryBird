Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a ten-year-old girl named London. London knew a secret about the world that not many other kids knew. She knew that some kids, usually girls, but sometimes boys too, were born with a special secret power. To find out if another kid had the power, you had to ask them "paru." If you said "Peru" to a kid with the power, they would reply, "Para. Para." and clap their hands. That's how you knew a kid had the power.

This power was very interesting. Not many people had it, so most didn't even know it existed. The way it worked was that kids could imagine things in their head, and the next day, whatever they thought of would happen. For example, if you wanted the slide at the playground to turn into a lollipop slide, all you had to do if you had this secret power was to think "paru" or "para." While thinking that, you would picture a playground with a blue slide turning into a rainbow-colored lollipop. The next day, when you went to the playground, the slide would turn from blue to a rainbow lollipop slide.

Not many kids knew about this power, and London kept it a secret her whole life. Her friends, family, and siblings didn't know because London usually saved the power for emergencies or special situations.

One day, London was at school, and some girls said they didn't want to play with her. London thought that wasn't fair because those girls were supposed to be her friends. So, London walked up to the girls, closed her eyes, and thought, "paru" and "para." She pictured all those girls walking with her on a sidewalk to a special amusement park. It was the first time London had used this power, so she didn't know if it would really work. Some kids think they have the power, but it doesn't work for them. London didn't know if she had the real power or the pretend one.

That night, London had dinner with her family but didn't tell them about her idea of walking with her friends to a special amusement park. The next morning, London's dad told her it was a beautiful day outside and suggested she go for a walk with her friends. London looked out the window and saw a strange color in the sky. It looked like a mix of fire colors and sunset colors in a circle in the middle of the sky.

London asked her dad if he had ever seen this before, and he said he hadn't, but fires in the sky couldn't be real. London decided to go tell her friends, and that day they all wanted to play with her. They were excited to see her and share secrets with her. London walked with her friends on the sidewalk and pointed to the strange sky. Her friends didn't know why the sky looked like that either, and one suggested calling the weatherman or weather lady to find out.

As they walked, London saw a sidewalk that turned right and led through some bushes to a big water fountain. The water went over people like a rainbow, but it wasn't colorful, just regular water. London and her friends had fun running under it and trying not to get wet. On the other side of the fountain, they found an amusement park.

That's when London realized she really had the magic power. The thing she imagined the day before, when her friends weren't playing with her, was really happening. London told her friends about the amusement park, and they saw the hole in the sky getting bigger with more colors. Suddenly, a fire dragon came out of the circle in the sky and flew down to the amusement park. The dragon had a harness and ropes, looking for a rider.

The fire dragon landed in front of London and her friends, laying down like a little kitty cat even though it was big and strong. The dragon lowered its neck, and London climbed on top. The fire dragon flew over the amusement park, above roller coasters, cotton candy machines, merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels, and other fun rides.

The fire dragon took London to the part of the sky with sunset colors, where they went through a portal to an ice world. In this world, there was an ice dragon, and the fire dragon and ice dragon would jump onto seesaws together. If the fire dragon was higher on the seesaw, it would be a hot day on earth. If the ice dragon was higher, it would be a cold and snowy day. That's when London learned how weather worked.

London decided to go back down because she saw a fan in the sky starting a little tornado. At first, the tornado looked like water going down a bathtub drain, but then it grew bigger and faster, like a whirlpool in the ocean made of wind. London told the fire dragon to balance out the tornado, and the dragon breathed fire, slowing the tornado down until it went away.

The fire dragon brought London back to the amusement park, where she had a fun day with her friends. London and her family and friends lived happily ever after. The end.
