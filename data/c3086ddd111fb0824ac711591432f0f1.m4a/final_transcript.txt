Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. But Jonah and Jesse weren't real kids, and they didn't even live in the real world. They lived inside a children's book. One day, they were in somebody's house, and a mom was reading the story called "The Adventures of Jonah and Jesse." She had a pen in her hand, and she put the pen in the book. Then she told the child she was reading to that she had to leave the room and tucked the child into bed.

Later that evening, Jonah and Jesse were trapped in the book, but now there was a pen inside it. Jonah grabbed the pen and started to write. He saw that his picture could kind of go out of the book. Jesse also saw that if he held onto the pen, he could go out of the book, too. They were able to write letters, and whatever they wrote came true.

As the child was sleeping, Jonah and Jesse wrote that they should sneak out of the book. So they did, and they found themselves on the floor of the child's room. They started sneaking across the carpet to get to the child's dresser. It was dark in the room because it was nighttime and the child was sleeping. Jonah and Jesse climbed on top of the dresser and saw a trophy the child had won for gymnastics.

The trophy was made of titanium and had a wooden base. Jonah and Jesse climbed onto the trophy and when they touched it, they turned into little people made out of half titanium with wooden shoes. That's when the child woke up and saw them. The child looked at the book on the floor and figured out what happened.

Jonah and Jesse were happy to see the child, and they told the child to pick them up. The child put Jonah on one shoulder and Jesse on the other. Then they went to the child's mom's room to tell her what happened. But the mom couldn't see Jonah and Jesse and thought the child was making it up. Jonah and Jesse whispered in the child's ear that only kids could see them.

The mom sent the child back to bed, and Jonah and Jesse stayed by the child's pillow. While the child slept, they decided to write in the book that their parents should come out too. So they did, and pictures of Amanda and Steve, their parents, came out of the book. Jonah and Jesse told them to climb up the dresser and touch the trophy to become like them.

But when Steve and Amanda touched the trophy, they turned into washing machines with lots of legs instead. They walked around in a silly way, making lots of noise that woke up the child again. The child knew they needed help and went to get their parents. But while the child was gone, Steve and Amanda accidentally moved the pen in the book, and it wrote that everyone should go back inside.

So, Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda turned back into pictures in the book. When the child returned with their mom, they were gone, and the mom thought the child was tricking her again. But really, it all happened, and Jonah, Jesse, Steve, and Amanda lived happily ever after inside their book. The end.
