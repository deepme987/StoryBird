Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a four-year-old girl named Samantha. Samantha and her family lived in a regular house. But one day, Samantha told her mom and dad that they should move to a houseboat on a lake. Her mom and dad thought it was a great idea. So, Samantha packed her things in her suitcase, and her mom and dad packed their things too. They got in their car and drove all the way to the lake.

When they arrived at the lake, they saw a big boat with a whole house on top. Samantha said they were going to live in that houseboat for a special adventure. Her parents agreed, and they got on the houseboat, which was floating in the water. The houseboat was really big. It had an upstairs bedroom that Samantha decided to share with her parents. Downstairs, there was a room filled with toys, like unicorn toys, bubbles to blow, and even a rainbow carpet.

Samantha told her parents they should set off on an adventure. The next day, after Samantha had breakfast, her parents decided to sail the houseboat on their adventure. The sky was cloudy, and Samantha's dad became the captain of the ship. He asked, "Who's ready for an adventure?" Samantha's mom started rowing the boat with big oars, moving from one side to the other.

As they were rowing, they saw something come out of the water. It was a shark with big teeth! At first, it looked scary, but then Samantha saw that it was a rainbow shark. The rainbow shark told Samantha it had a unicorn friend. The unicorn couldn't swim well, so the shark would give it rides, and the shark's big teeth kept them both safe. Samantha asked where the unicorn was, and the shark said there was a problem. The night before, instead of regular rain, it rained bubbles. One big bubble got the unicorn stuck and floated away.

Samantha told the shark she could help find the unicorn because they had a houseboat. They rowed towards where the bubble storm came from and found an island. The island had red sand, trees that grew grapes, and bushes that grew pretzels. There was even a talking, singing, and dancing Mr. Potato Head! The island also had fish that could walk on land, and some wore hats or glasses.

As Samantha explored the island, she noticed a water tower that smelled like strawberries. She followed the smell and saw butterflies carrying strawberries to the top of the tower. Samantha, her mom, and dad followed the butterflies and climbed a ladder to the top of the water tower. Inside, they found strawberry juice and the unicorn stuck in a bubble. Samantha popped the bubble, freeing the unicorn. The unicorn was happy because it loved strawberry juice.

Samantha made a rule that butterflies on the island could carry strawberries to water towers and grapes from trees to people. When people wanted a snack, they would say "dingaboong," and butterflies would bring them different treats like grapes, strawberries, chocolate, or bananas.

Samantha and her parents had dinner on the island, with butterflies bringing them lots of food. Then they went back to their boat and sailed home, living happily ever after. The end.
