Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a big boy named River. River lived in a house in Eugene, Oregon. One day, when he looked outside the window, it was so foggy. He said, "Mom, it's so foggy outside, I can hardly see." His mom replied, "River, I don't think that's fog. I think that is smoke." River asked, "Oh, no, what should we do?" His mom suggested, "Let's stay inside for a few days." River agreed, "Okay." River and his baby brother Indy started to play a game. They pretended to be turtles, but not just any turtles, they dressed up as Ninja Turtles! Ninja Turtles wear bands around their heads and have special abilities. River's Ninja Turtle was strong, fast, and good at jumping. Baby brother Indy also dressed up as a Ninja Turtle, but he could only crawl a little bit.

As River and Indy played inside, they discovered a magical door in the back of their house. This door led to a secret tunnel with a rainbow covering that blocked out all the smoke. River, Indy, and their mom decided to go into the tunnel. Inside, they found a slide that took them to an underground playground with a skate park. But guess what? Real Ninja Turtles were there! One Ninja Turtle was on a floating skateboard, another on a bicycle with sideways wheels, and the third on a scooter with tennis balls for wheels. The Ninja Turtles were holding ice cream, a popsicle, and a cake.

River said to his mom, "I didn't know this underground Ninja Turtle place existed!" Just then, the Ninja Turtles noticed them and started to march. They led River, Indy, and their mom to the top of the skate park where they found upside-down swings! These swings had seatbelts to hold them in place as they swung from the top. It was fun but a little bit scary. Baby Indy started to cry, and the Ninja Turtles' treats fell to the ground, making a big mess. River reassured Indy, "It's okay. These are Ninja Turtles, and they have super-duper ways to clean." He asked the Ninja Turtles if they had special ways to clean, and they said yes.

The Ninja Turtles took River down from the swing using a fun slide pole. At the bottom, they revealed their special cleaning invention: a tractor attached to skateboards with a big vacuum cleaner underneath. River, Indy, and the Ninja Turtles all climbed onto the tractor and began to clean up the mess. The tractor spun round and round, making a funny noise as it vacuumed up the ice cream, popsicle, and cake. Indy spilled his bottle on purpose so they could use the cleaning machine again, and the Ninja Turtles said it was okay.

Soon, it was time to go home. Instead of going back through the secret tunnel, they went through an underground ice cream shop. In this shop, turtles served ice cream in cones as big as people! River and Indy each got a cone, and Indy even put some ice cream in his bottle to drink. River's mom thought that was so silly. They climbed up a secret ladder to return to their house. When they looked out the window, the smoke had cleared. River, Indy, their family, and the Ninja Turtles all lived happily ever after. The end.
