Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a three-year-old boy named Henry. One day, Henry woke up, and his mama told him it was his special birthday, and they were going on a birthday adventure. Henry didn't think it was his birthday, but his mama said it was a secret birthday. So, Henry agreed, and his mama put him in the stroller, and they went for a walk to the cake store.

When they arrived at the cake store, Henry's mama told the baker she wanted a birthday cake because Henry was turning four years old. But the baker said there were no cakes left, only cookies. Henry asked his mama to find out why there were no cakes. So, his mama asked the baker, and he explained that earlier that day, a bunch of monkeys had jumped down from trees, opened the door, and ate all the cakes. Some of the monkeys even took cakes back to their monkey homes and trees.

Henry told his mom that since there were no cakes, they should have a chocolate chip cookie. It was such a big and yummy cookie that Henry ate some. But he still wanted a real cake for his special birthday. So, his mama agreed, and they continued their adventure to the beach.

At the beach, Henry noticed a big ship partly in the water and partly out of the water. He asked his mom if it was sinking, and she explained that it was a submarine, a special kind of boat that can go underwater. Henry asked if they could go inside.

Henry and his mama walked up to the submarine and knocked on the door. To their surprise, a robot opened the door and said, "I am a robot. I live in a submarine." Henry asked his mama if it was a real robot, and she said she thought so. The robot then gave Henry a magical seed that glowed in the dark.

Henry told his mom they should plant the glowing seed in their backyard. They found a safe spot, dug a hole, and planted the seed. Even though it was underground, the seed still glowed, making the ground shine with a green light. They watered the seed, and it began to glow different colors.

That night, Henry went to sleep, and the next day, he discovered the seed had grown into a robot banana tree. The tree was made of metal, like a robot, and had bananas where its hands and fingers would be. The robot tree grew bigger and bigger and then said, "I want some lemonade."

Henry and his mama made lemonade and used a water gun to squirt it into the robot's mouth. After thanking them, the robot produced a huge pile of bananas that grew as high as the clouds.

Suddenly, the sneaky monkeys from the cake store appeared, attracted by the smell of bananas. Henry and his mom decided to make a pile of bananas for the monkeys and another pile for people. The monkeys were so happy with Henry that they brought him a special ice cream cake they had saved in their monkey trees.

That night, Henry had a birthday party with his friends, and they put four candles on the cake because he was turning four. All his friends brought toys and presents, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
