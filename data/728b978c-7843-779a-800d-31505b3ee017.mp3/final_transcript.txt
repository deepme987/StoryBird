Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. They lived on a big carrot farm where lots of carrots grew all over. On the farm, there was a tractor that looked a little strange. Normal tractors have two big wheels in the back and smaller wheels in the front, but this tractor had a giant metal wheel on top of it. Whenever Jonah and Jesse asked their parents about the extra wheel, their parents said, "Don't ask about that tractor. It's a secret."

One day, Jonah and Jesse were eating hot dogs for lunch on their patio. They saw a red rabbit running through the carrot field. It was the first red rabbit they had ever seen! They decided to chase it to see if they could catch it. The red rabbit ran all the way to the tractor and hid under it. Jonah and Jesse didn't want to go under the tractor, so they waited on both sides to catch the rabbit if it came out.

As they were waiting, the tractor's engine started on its own! The tractor began to sink into the ground, and the whole platform went under. Jonah and Jesse thought it was an earthquake because the ground shook. They ran back to their farmhouse to tell their parents what happened.

When they told their parents, Steve and Amanda, about the red rabbit and the tractor, Steve said, "Pretend you never saw that." Jonah and Jesse wanted to know why. Amanda asked if the extra wheel on the tractor started turning and turned red. Jesse said it did.

Amanda and Steve looked at each other, and suddenly they started floating in the air! They told Jonah and Jesse they had a secret. They were actually aliens from a red planet called Mars! They came to Earth on a spaceship with a red spinning top, which they parked on the farm and disguised as a tractor. The aliens on Mars looked like red rabbits and loved eating carrots, but carrots didn't grow on Mars. That's why they started a carrot farm on Earth.

Jonah and Jesse asked if they could float too. Steve told them to close their eyes, think "float, float, float," and wave their arms. They tried it, and they started floating!

The family floated outside to the barbecue grill. Jonah saw the marshmallows and said they didn't look yummy anymore. He floated to the carrots and started eating them, saying they were yummier than marshmallows.

They all floated to the spaceship, which was hidden in the ground. Inside, they found the red rabbit, who was really their uncle Rebela from Mars. Rebela needed to get Mars closer to Earth, so he used a special telescope with a strong magnet inside.

Rebela changed into a person who looked like Jonah's dad, Steve. He let Jonah and Jesse look through the telescope. They saw Mars as a red dot in the sky. Jesse looked closer, and Mars got closer and closer. The spaceship went higher and higher into the air as Mars got closer. Jonah found a trick to make them go even faster by using a magnifying glass on the telescope lens.

Soon, they arrived on Mars. Jesse brought some carrots for the many red rabbits there. Jonah and Jesse wanted to change into rabbits too, so their parents taught them the magic words. They turned into red rabbits and played a fun game of tag in the tunnels on Mars.

Afterward, they went back to Earth and turned back into people. They lived happily ever after, sometimes as people and sometimes as rabbits when they wanted to play fun games of tag. The end.
