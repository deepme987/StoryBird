Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Lou. Lou lived in a small town where all the houses had just two rooms. The houses had a kitchen and a bathroom, and everybody slept on their roofs. Their roofs were a bit slanted, so they needed ropes to hold up their beds and keep them snug at night. In the morning, they would slide down a pole to use the bathroom. The pole had a soft mat at the bottom so that kids wouldn't get a boo boo.

One day, Lou decided he wanted to make a blackberry pie with his mom. Lou's mom agreed, and they set out to look for wild blackberries. Lou put on his clothes, his mom packed a snack, and they brought a backpack with ice-cold sippy water. Lou also brought his dog named Woody, and they all went on a blackberry picking adventure.

As they searched for blackberries, they found that the best time to pick them was in the middle of summer when the berries were ripe. First, the berries would be green, then red, and finally black. When they were all black and easy to pick, that's when they tasted sweet and yummy.

Lou, his mom, and their dog Woody went blackberry picking together. Woody had a funny way of picking blackberries because he couldn't use his paws. Instead, he wore a special helmet with pretend arms that would pick the berries for him when he stomped on the ground. The helmet's hands would take the blackberries off the bush and put them in a bucket.

While picking blackberries, they saw a little river behind the bushes. There was no way to get to the other side, so they looked around for a solution. Suddenly, Woody barked, and they found a troll bridge. Lou and his mom followed Woody to the bridge, which led to a different set of raspberry bushes. They wanted to pick both blackberries and raspberries for their pie.

As they crossed the bridge, Lou went first. He walked across, and a troll under the bridge asked who was crossing. Lou explained that he was picking blackberries, and the troll let him pass. Next, Woody crossed, and his barking scared the troll away. Lou's mom didn't have to worry about the troll, as it was afraid of dogs. The troll hid under the bridge, where some frogs started jumping on him. One of the frogs was poisonous, and when it licked the troll, he became frozen.

Woody approached the frozen troll and barked, but the troll couldn't move. Lou and his mom called Woody to the other side of the river, where they picked blackberries and raspberries. On their way back, they noticed a twinkly, sparkly berry among their collection. Woody took the special berry and brought it to the frozen troll. Using his helmet's robot arms, Woody placed the berry on the troll, who unfroze and turned back into a regular person.

The former troll apologized for being mean and thanked Woody. He followed Woody back to Lou and his mom, and they all realized that the troll was just a nice person who had been stuck in a bad troll body. Lou and his mom apologized for crossing the troll's bridge, and the troll said that from now on, anyone could use his bridge.

That day, Lou, Woody, and Lou's mom brought all their berries home and made the yummiest blackberry pie. They even shared a piece with the now-nice troll. Lou, Woody, and his family lived happily ever after. The end. Tell all your friends to listen to this story because they'll like it.
