Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy named Evan. One day, Evan and his family needed to buy groceries, so they went to the supermarket near their house. As they walked through the aisles, Evan reminded his mom that they needed more eggs. So, Evan sat in the shopping cart while he and his mom went to the egg section.

When they got there, they saw that there were no regular eggs left. Instead, there was a blue egg carton with blue eggs inside. Evan had never seen blue eggs before, so he asked his mom if they would make regular scrambled eggs. His mom said there was only one way to find out.

Evan suggested they go home and try the eggs first, but his mom reminded him they needed to buy grapes, bananas, and honey too. So they got purple grapes, honey in a bear-shaped container, and the most special thing of all, bananas. After paying for their groceries, they went back to Evan's house.

At home, they decided to make a special midday breakfast lunch with the blue eggs. When Evan opened the egg carton, he found that all the blue eggs were cracked, and instead of eggs, there were geckos inside! The geckos had little houses in the eggs, complete with moss and tiny toys.

Evan was very surprised and wondered why there were gecko eggs in the supermarket. His mom thought it must have been a mistake. But before they knew it, the geckos had climbed out of their eggs and started running around Evan's house, eventually making their way to his room.

The geckos climbed all over Evan's bed, and as they did, they made a sound that seemed to say "monkey, monkey." Suddenly, a magical monkey with a gecko-like face appeared from under Evan's covers. The monkey smelled the bananas downstairs and quickly brought them and the honey back to Evan's room.

The magical monkey told Evan that the honey was magical too, and if he poured it on his bed, it would turn into a castle. Evan didn't believe the monkey, so they decided to try it out. The monkey squeezed the honey all over Evan's bed, and the geckos licked it up.

As the geckos licked the honey, Evan's bed transformed into a giant castle that went through the ceiling of his room. The castle had floating elevators, rocks and sticks for the geckos to play on, and the magical monkey pretended to be the king of the castle.

The magical monkey told the geckos to pretend they were soldiers guarding the castle from a thousand other monkeys. The geckos used their tails to create wind, which knocked the pretend monkeys over. The monkeys decided to be nice and asked if they could join the fun in the castle.

Evan agreed, and the monkeys entered the castle through the bottom, where Evan's bed used to be. The magical monkey told the other monkeys to behave and play nicely, or else he would turn them into shadows. The monkeys agreed and went to the playground inside the castle.

Evan and his family explored the castle, finding many game rooms and even a room so big that it reached the clouds. But as it got late, Evan asked the geckos to turn his bed back into a regular bed. The geckos did a silly thing with their tails, and the bed returned to normal.

That night, Evan went to sleep with the magical monkey and geckos by his side. Evan and his family lived happily ever after. The end.
