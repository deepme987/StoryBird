Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were two kids named Jonah and Jesse. They were inside their house all day, and they were so bored because there were no games to play. Their mom said, "Well, why don't you just play with your toys?" Jesse replied, "Well, my toys are just so boring." Jonah added, "Mom, you don't even know, there's nothing that we could even do in the house."

So Jonah and Jesse sat down on the couch, thinking of different games they could play. Just as they were thinking, they heard a big crash right outside their house in the backyard. They went to the window that looked out to the backyard and saw a big meteor that had crashed into the grass, leaving a hole where it landed.

Jonah and Jesse called out, "Mom, Dad, come look! A meteor crashed into our backyard." They all went outside together. Jesse warned, "Careful, everyone. There are lots of little blue creatures crawling out of the meteor." Jonah looked closely and saw that they weren't really ants because ants aren't blue. These creatures had antennas on their heads with little brooms attached to them and tubes, like hoses, going into their mouths.

Jonah and Jesse wondered if these were aliens that came from the meteor in outer space. They watched as the blue creatures went inside the house and started cleaning up all the messes. The creatures used the brooms on their antennas to sweep up crumbs and the tubes attached to their mouths to vacuum up everything.

Jonah had an idea. "I think they came to help us," he said. "How about we spill some cereal on the floor?" Jesse agreed, and they spilled cereal on the floor. The little blue creatures quickly went to the cereal, and whenever one of them ate a piece or swept it up or sucked it down its tube, that blue creature became two blue creatures and grew bigger.

Soon there were so many blue creatures all over the place. They started looking at Jonah and Jesse, and they began climbing up Jesse's pants. Jesse tried to shoo them away, but it was too late. A whole line of blue creatures climbed up Jesse's pants and into his pocket, where they found some crumbs from a pretzel Jesse had kept there a few days ago. When they came out of Jesse's pocket, there were twice as many little blue creatures.

The blue creatures were so happy because they had so much to eat. They went into Jonah's pockets, and Jonah didn't want them to go in his pockets either. They found a whole piece of chocolate that Jonah had saved up, and they ate it. When they came out, there was a long line of blue creatures, and they had made at least 10,000 more.

The blue creatures started to say, "Me eat people. Me eat people." Jonah and Jesse thought the blue creatures were going to eat them, so they decided they had to do something to stop them.

They ran outside as fast as they could, turned on the hose, and sprayed the blue creatures with water. The creatures couldn't sweep up the water with their brooms, so they had to vacuum it up with their tubes. They drank so much water that they became like water balloons. Jonah and Jesse grabbed their nerf guns, attached little pins to the end of the nerf bullets, and started shooting the blue creatures, making them explode and water splashing everywhere.

After the blue creatures exploded, they left notes that said, "We're from another planet, and we came here just to help kids clean up." Jonah read the note and told Jesse that they made a mistake trying to fill up the blue creatures with water because they were actually cleaner aliens.

The cleaner aliens came from a different planet to help people clean up everything, so they wouldn't have to clean up after playing games or put away toys by themselves. That's why they had brooms attached to their antennas and hoses.

Jonah and Jesse felt bad that they used their nerf guns to explode the blue creatures, so they went to the meteor to see if there was anything they could do to help. They found a kind of blue glue inside the meteor.

Jonah suggested, "How about if we squeeze this blue glue all over the place where the blue creatures were and see what happens? Maybe it's like a medicine for them." They did that, and all the creatures came back together, got small again, and were happy that Jonah fixed them with the blue glue. They promised never to go into people's pockets again and to always just clean up.

From then on, whenever kids needed to clean up, the little blue aliens would clean up for them. Jonah and Jesse kept their discovery a secret and hid the meteor. They never had to clean up again, and they, along with their little blue alien friends, lived happily ever after. The end.
