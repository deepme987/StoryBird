Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a big boy named David. David lived near the North Pole, where it was very snowy and cold. Instead of living in a regular house, David's family lived in an igloo made of snow and ice. Everything inside the igloo was made of snow and ice, except for a carpet, beds, and a special play area filled with toys like dolls, teddy bears, monster trucks, and even a special helicopter Barbie that could transform from a doll into a helicopter.

David loved playing in his igloo, and sometimes his friends from other igloos would come over after school to play in his special toy room. One winter day, David told his family that it was too cold and they should go on a trip somewhere warmer. So, his parents packed their suitcases, and David packed his own little suitcase with paw patrol pictures on it, filled with his favorite toys, including a baby shark toy.

David's family loaded their suitcases into their monster truck, which they needed to drive in the North Pole because of all the snow. David got into his car seat, and some of his friends asked if they could join the adventure. Their parents agreed, and everyone set off in their monster trucks, playing music and waving goodbye to their igloo town.

They drove through lots of snow until it started to get dark. They found a restaurant next to a big, deep lake. The restaurant was filled with strawberries hanging from the ceiling and Cheerios on the floor that crunched like sand when they stepped on them. There was a special machine that made milk come out when they pressed a button, and the kids thought it was the most fun restaurant ever.

After eating, they needed to find a way across the big, deep lake. Luckily, they heard a foghorn and saw a ferry boat coming. The silly captain of the ferry boat came into the restaurant and got soaked with orange juice when he pressed a button. The kids laughed, and the captain dried off with a blow dryer. David asked the silly captain if they could put their monster trucks on the ferry boat to cross the lake, and the captain agreed after eating his chocolate raspberry pudding.

The kids and parents got back into their monster trucks and drove onto the ferry. While on the ferry, David opened his suitcase to share his toys with the other kids. One of the kids accidentally threw David's toy shark into the lake, and David started to cry. His mom asked what happened, and they saw real sharks playing with the toy shark but getting caught in seaweed.

David told the silly captain about the sharks, and the captain put his hat on David, announcing an emergency rescue. The ferry boat had a special arm that could grab the sharks and save them from the seaweed. After saving the sharks, the arm grabbed David's toy shark and returned it to him. David thanked the captain, who let him keep the captain's hat.

When they reached the other side of the lake, they found a zoo with friendly tigers that they could ride. This side of the North Pole was much warmer than their igloo town. After having fun at the zoo, they continued driving to a warm place with a sandbox, slides, and rope courses. They decided to stay there for a vacation and shared David's toys.

David was so good at sharing that all his friends said he was the best. The silly captain let David keep his captain's hat and promised to be there when they needed a ride back across the lake. David and his friends from the igloo town had a great vacation in the warm, sandy place, and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
