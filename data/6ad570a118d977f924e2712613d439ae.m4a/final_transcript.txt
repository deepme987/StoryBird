Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a three-year-old girl named Reese. Reese lived close to the ocean and always wanted to take a ferry to the other side, hoping to find special things along the way. One day, Reese asked her dad, "Dad, can we go on a ferry ride? We can explore the ocean and make sure there's a real captain on the ferry!" Reese's dad agreed.

The next day, they brought their fishing rod, some bubbles, and snacks, and went to board the ferry. The ferry was so big that it could carry 17 cars and 84 people! There were places on the ferry where kids could get cookies, and others where they could get orange juice and apple juice. You could go to the top of the ferry and see the ocean and the clouds, or go inside and find toy pony rides. The pretend ponies would make you go up and down, up and down.

As they were sailing, Reese noticed that the clouds in the sky started changing colors and it began to rain bubbles! Bubbles fell from the clouds instead of rain. Reese told the captain, "Captain, bubbles are coming down from the sky, and it's not good for the fishies." The captain saw the colorful bubbles and announced, "Attention everyone! For the first time ever, it's raining bubbles from the sky. These bubbles have no soap and seem to pop before they reach the water. They might be magic bubbles."

Just as the captain said that, a huge bubble, bigger than a building, covered the entire ferry. The bubble took the ferry underwater, but it didn't pop. Everyone could breathe because they were inside the magic bubble.

The ferry went deeper into the ocean until it reached the bottom. Reese was the first to see a magical bubble city that looked like a lost city from long ago. The ferry entered the city's bubble and parked in the airport, where they saw special submarine airplanes.

This city was home to all the unicorns! The sky was covered in red, green, and blue blinking Christmas lights, making it very pretty. The unicorns played special games, jumped high, swung on swings, shared strawberries, and ate yogurt.

These unicorns had fans at the end of their horns to move around the city. They would turn the fan on and fly like helicopters. Sometimes, their fans made different sounds like motorcycles or police cars.

A unicorn asked Reese and her brother Sam if they wanted a ride. With their dad's permission, they rode on unicorns with car seats strapped to them. They flew around and saw an amusement park with cotton candy, a ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, and many fun rides.

But Reese noticed their bubble with the ferry was starting to rise, so they hurried back. Reese, her dad, and her brother Sam got on the ferry, and the bubble went back to the top of the ocean. Reese told her parents about their amazing adventure in the hidden underwater bubble city where unicorns lived. The ferry took them back home to Everett, Washington, and Reese and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
