Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a six-year-old girl named Everleigh. Everleigh had lots of fun ideas for her house, so she told her parents they needed to replace all the floors with trampoline floors. Can you believe it? And whenever anyone visited Everleigh's house, they had to be careful not to jump too high. One day, a doggie came into Everly's house and jumped so high that it got stuck in a net on the ceiling! Everly and her mom had to help the doggie get down, and that's when Everly made a rule: no jumping too high on the trampoline floor.

Everleigh loved doing other things too, like somersaults, tumbling, and spinning. She also had a special ability to balance on a rope. One day, she saw a deer wearing shoes in her backyard. The deer asked if it could try the trampoline floor, and Everly agreed, but only if the deer took off its shoes. Everly's mom helped take off the magical deer's shoes, and the deer went inside. The magical deer was friends with a spider named Spinny, who decided to make a spider web tightrope. Everleigh asked what that was, and Spinny explained that it was a strong spider web that could hold a person up as they walked across it.

Spinny the spider was the king of all spiders and came from a planet shaped like a spider. He took a spider rocket ship to Earth and became friends with the magical deer. Spinny made fun spider webs all over Everleigh's house, and the magical deer even walked upside down on them! Everly's mom saw the mess and was worried, but Everly reassured her that Spinny was great at cleaning. Spinny had a vacuum cleaner mouth, and when Everly pressed a button on his nose, he cleaned up all the spider webs.

Everly's mom thanked Spinny for cleaning and was glad the magical deer wasn't wearing shoes on the trampoline floor. She asked if they all wanted to play Ring Around the Rosie together. Spinny couldn't stand as tall as the others, so he sat on Everly's shoulder. They all played and had fun until they fell down and bounced up high. In the air, Spinny made a special floating spider web that held them all up. Everly attached an engine to the web, and they flew through the house.

As they flew, Everleigh noticed something on top of the refrigerator that she couldn't usually see. It was her mom's secret phone that you could go inside of! When you touched the phone, you could go inside it and come out by saying the password, which was "kitty cat meow." Everly, the deer, and Spinny all went inside the phone and had fun playing with characters from Wheels on the Bus, Paw Patrol, and Frozen. They even played with the Itsy Bitsy Spider!

When it was time for dinner, Everly's mom told the deer and Spinny to come back another day. They all said goodbye, and Everly had dinner with her parents before putting on her pajamas and going to sleep. Everly and her family lived happily ever after. The end.
